IESG Note\
\
   The following documents  (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408)\
   are published simultaneously as Experimental RFCs, although there is\
   no general technical consensus and efforts to reconcile the two\
   approaches have failed.  As such, these documents have not received\
   full IETF review and are published "AS-IS" to document the different\
   approaches as they were considered in the MARID working group.\
\
   The IESG takes no position about which approach is to be preferred\
   and cautions the reader that there are serious open issues for each\
   approach and concerns about using them in tandem.  The IESG believes\
   that documenting the different approaches does less harm than not\
   documenting them.\
\
   Note that the Sender ID experiment may use DNS records that may have\
   been created for the current SPF experiment or earlier versions in\
   this set of experiments.  Depending on the content of the record,\
   this may mean that Sender-ID heuristics would be applied incorrectly\
   to a message.  Depending on the actions associated by the recipient\
   with those heuristics, the message may not be delivered or may be\
   discarded on receipt.\
\
   Participants relying on Sender ID experiment DNS records are warned\
   that they may lose valid messages in this set of circumstances.\
   aParticipants publishing SPF experiment DNS records should consider\
   the advice given in section 3.4 of RFC 4406 and may wish to publish\
   both v=spf1 and spf2.0 records to avoid the conflict.\

\
\
   Participants in the Sender-ID experiment need to be aware that the\
   way Resent-* header fields are used will result in failure to receive\
   legitimate email when interacting with standards-compliant systems\
   (specifically automatic forwarders which comply with the standards by\
   not adding Resent-* headers, and systems which comply with RFC 822\
   but have not yet implemented RFC 2822 Resent-* semantics).  It would\
   be inappropriate to advance Sender-ID on the standards track without\
   resolving this interoperability problem.\
\
   The community is invited to observe the success or failure of the two\
   approaches during the two years following publication, in order that\
   a community consensus can be reached in the future.\
\
Abstract\
\
   E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In\
   particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending\
   host can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on\
   the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of\
   the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby a domain may\
   explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain\
   name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The current E-Mail infrastructure has the property that any host\
   injecting mail into the mail system can identify itself as any domain\
   name it wants.  Hosts can do this at a variety of levels: in\
   particular, the session, the envelope, and the mail headers.\
   Although this feature is desirable in some circumstances, it is a\
   major obstacle to reducing Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail (UBE, aka spam).\
   Furthermore, many domain name holders are understandably concerned\
   about the ease with which other entities may make use of their domain\
   names, often with malicious intent.\
\
   This document defines a protocol by which domain owners may authorize\
   hosts to use their domain name in the "MAIL FROM" or "HELO" identity.\
   Compliant domain holders publish Sender Policy Framework (SPF)\
   records specifying which hosts are permitted to use their names, and\
   compliant mail receivers use the published SPF records to test the\
   authorization of sending Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) using a given\
   "HELO" or "MAIL FROM" identity during a mail transaction.\
\
   An additional benefit to mail receivers is that after the use of an\
   identity is verified, local policy decisions about the mail can be\
   made based on the sender's domain, rather than the host's IP address.\
   This is advantageous because reputation of domain names is likely to\
   be more accurate than reputation of host IP addresses.  Furthermore,\
   if a claimed identity fails verification, local policy can take\
   stronger action against such E-Mail, such as rejecting it.\
\
1.1.  Protocol Status\
\
   SPF has been in development since the summer of 2003 and has seen\
   deployment beyond the developers beginning in December 2003.  The\
   design of SPF slowly evolved until the spring of 2004 and has since\
   stabilized.  There have been quite a number of forms of SPF, some\
   written up as documents, some submitted as Internet Drafts, and many\
   discussed and debated in development forums.\
\
   The goal of this document is to clearly document the protocol defined\
   by earlier draft specifications of SPF as used in existing\
   implementations.  This conception of SPF is sometimes called "SPF\
   Classic".  It is understood that particular implementations and\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   deployments may differ from, and build upon, this work.  It is hoped\
   that we have nonetheless captured the common understanding of SPF\
   version 1.\
\
1.2.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   This document is concerned with the portion of a mail message\
   commonly called "envelope sender", "return path", "reverse path",\
   "bounce address", "2821 FROM", or "MAIL FROM".  Since these terms are\
   either not well defined or often used casually, this document defines\
   the "MAIL FROM" identity in Section 2.2.  Note that other terms that\
   may superficially look like the common terms, such as "reverse-path",\
   are used only with the defined meanings from normative documents.\
\
2.  Operation\
\
2.1.  The HELO Identity\
\
   The "HELO" identity derives from either the SMTP HELO or EHLO command\
   (see [RFC2821]).  These commands supply the SMTP client (sending\
   host) for the SMTP session.  Note that requirements for the domain\
   presented in the EHLO or HELO command are not always clear to the\
   sending party, and SPF clients must be prepared for the "HELO"\
   identity to be malformed or an IP address literal.  At the time of\
   this writing, many legitimate E-Mails are delivered with invalid HELO\
   domains.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that SPF clients not only check the "MAIL FROM"\
   identity, but also separately check the "HELO" identity by applying\
   the check_host() function (Section 4) to the "HELO" identity as the\
   <sender>.\
\
2.2.  The MAIL FROM Identity\
\
   The "MAIL FROM" identity derives from the SMTP MAIL command (see\
   [RFC2821]).  This command supplies the "reverse-path" for a message,\
   which generally consists of the sender mailbox, and is the mailbox to\
   which notification messages are to be sent if there are problems\
   delivering the message.\
\
   [RFC2821] allows the reverse-path to be null (see Section 4.5.5 in\
   RFC 2821).  In this case, there is no explicit sender mailbox, and\
   such a message can be assumed to be a notification message from the\
   mail system itself.  When the reverse-path is null, this document\
\
\
\
Wong & Schlitt                Experimental                      [Page 5]\
\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   defines the "MAIL FROM" identity to be the mailbox composed of the\
   localpart "postmaster" and the "HELO" identity (which may or may not\
   have been checked separately before).\
\
   SPF clients MUST check the "MAIL FROM" identity.  SPF clients check\
   the "MAIL FROM" identity by applying the check_host() function to the\
   "MAIL FROM" identity as the <sender>.\
\
2.3.  Publishing Authorization\
\
   An SPF-compliant domain MUST publish a valid SPF record as described\
   in Section 3.  This record authorizes the use of the domain name in\
   the "HELO" and "MAIL FROM" identities by the MTAs it specifies.\
\
   If domain owners choose to publish SPF records, it is RECOMMENDED\
   that they end in "-all", or redirect to other records that do, so\
   that a definitive determination of authorization can be made.\
\
   Domain holders may publish SPF records that explicitly authorize no\
   hosts if mail should never originate using that domain.\
\
   When changing SPF records, care must be taken to ensure that there is\
   a transition period so that the old policy remains valid until all\
   legitimate E-Mail has been checked.\
\
2.4.  Checking Authorization\
\
   A mail receiver can perform a set of SPF checks for each mail message\
   it receives.  An SPF check tests the authorization of a client host\
   to emit mail with a given identity.  Typically, such checks are done\
   by a receiving MTA, but can be performed elsewhere in the mail\
   processing chain so long as the required information is available and\
   reliable.  At least the "MAIL FROM" identity MUST be checked, but it\
   is RECOMMENDED that the "HELO" identity also be checked beforehand.\
\
   Without explicit approval of the domain owner, checking other\
   identities against SPF version 1 records is NOT RECOMMENDED because\
   there are cases that are known to give incorrect results.  For\
   example, almost all mailing lists rewrite the "MAIL FROM" identity\
   (see Section 9.2), but some do not change any other identities in the\
   message.  The scenario described in Section 9.3, sub-section 1.2, is\
   another example.  Documents that define other identities should\
   define the method for explicit approval.\
\
   It is possible that mail receivers will use the SPF check as part of\
   a larger set of tests on incoming mail.  The results of other tests\
   may influence whether or not a particular SPF check is performed.\
   For example, finding the sending host's IP address on a local white\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   list may cause all other tests to be skipped and all mail from that\
   host to be accepted.\
\
   When a mail receiver decides to perform an SPF check, it MUST use a\
   correctly-implemented check_host() function (Section 4) evaluated\
   with the correct parameters.  Although the test as a whole is\
   optional, once it has been decided to perform a test it must be\
   performed as specified so that the correct semantics are preserved\
   between publisher and receiver.\
\
   To make the test, the mail receiver MUST evaluate the check_host()\
   function with the arguments set as follows:\
\
   <ip>     - the IP address of the SMTP client that is emitting the\
              mail, either IPv4 or IPv6.\
\
   <domain> - the domain portion of the "MAIL FROM" or "HELO" identity.\
\
   <sender> - the "MAIL FROM" or "HELO" identity.\
\
   Note that the <domain> argument may not be a well-formed domain name.\
   For example, if the reverse-path was null, then the EHLO/HELO domain\
   is used, with its associated problems (see Section 2.1).  In these\
   cases, check_host() is defined in Section 4.3 to return a "None"\
   result.\
\
   Although invalid, malformed, or non-existent domains cause SPF checks\
   to return "None" because no SPF record can be found, it has long been\
   the policy of many MTAs to reject E-Mail from such domains,\
   especially in the case of invalid "MAIL FROM".  In order to prevent\
   the circumvention of SPF records, rejecting E-Mail from invalid\
   domains should be considered.\
\
   Implementations must take care to correctly extract the <domain> from\
   the data given with the SMTP MAIL FROM command as many MTAs will\
   still accept such things as source routes (see [RFC2821], Appendix\
   C), the %-hack (see [RFC1123]), and bang paths (see [RFC1983]).\
   These archaic features have been maliciously used to bypass security\
   systems.\
\
2.5.  Interpreting the Result\
\
   This section describes how software that performs the authorization\
   should interpret the results of the check_host() function.  The\
   authorization check SHOULD be performed during the processing of the\
   SMTP transaction that sends the mail.  This allows errors to be\
   returned directly to the sending MTA by way of SMTP replies.\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   Performing the authorization after the SMTP transaction has finished\
   may cause problems, such as the following: (1) It may be difficult to\
   accurately extract the required information from potentially\
   deceptive headers; (2) legitimate E-Mail may fail because the\
   sender's policy may have since changed.\
\
   Generating non-delivery notifications to forged identities that have\
   failed the authorization check is generally abusive and against the\
   explicit wishes of the identity owner.\
\
2.5.1.  None\
\
   A result of "None" means that no records were published by the domain\
   or that no checkable sender domain could be determined from the given\
   identity.  The checking software cannot ascertain whether or not the\
   client host is authorized.\
\
2.5.2.  Neutral\
\
   The domain owner has explicitly stated that he cannot or does not\
   want to assert whether or not the IP address is authorized.  A\
   "Neutral" result MUST be treated exactly like the "None" result; the\
   distinction exists only for informational purposes.  Treating\
   "Neutral" more harshly than "None" would discourage domain owners\
   from testing the use of SPF records (see Section 9.1).\
\
2.5.3.  Pass\
\
   A "Pass" result means that the client is authorized to inject mail\
   with the given identity.  The domain can now, in the sense of\
   reputation, be considered responsible for sending the message.\
   Further policy checks can now proceed with confidence in the\
   legitimate use of the identity.\
\
2.5.4.  Fail\
\
   A "Fail" result is an explicit statement that the client is not\
   authorized to use the domain in the given identity.  The checking\
   software can choose to mark the mail based on this or to reject the\
   mail outright.\
\
   If the checking software chooses to reject the mail during the SMTP\
   transaction, then it SHOULD use an SMTP reply code of 550 (see\
   [RFC2821]) and, if supported, the 5.7.1 Delivery Status Notification\
   (DSN) code (see [RFC3464]), in addition to an appropriate reply text.\
   The check_host() function may return either a default explanation\
   string or one from the domain that published the SPF records (see\
   Section 6.2).  If the information does not originate with the\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   checking software, it should be made clear that the text is provided\
   by the sender's domain.  For example:\
\
       550-5.7.1 SPF MAIL FROM check failed:\
       550-5.7.1 The domain example.com explains:\
       550 5.7.1 Please see http://www.example.com/mailpolicy.html\
\
2.5.5.  SoftFail\
\
   A "SoftFail" result should be treated as somewhere between a "Fail"\
   and a "Neutral".  The domain believes the host is not authorized but\
   is not willing to make that strong of a statement.  Receiving\
   software SHOULD NOT reject the message based solely on this result,\
   but MAY subject the message to closer scrutiny than normal.\
\
   The domain owner wants to discourage the use of this host and thus\
   desires limited feedback when a "SoftFail" result occurs.  For\
   example, the recipient's Mail User Agent (MUA) could highlight the\
   "SoftFail" status, or the receiving MTA could give the sender a\
   message using a technique called "greylisting" whereby the MTA can\
   issue an SMTP reply code of 451 (4.3.0 DSN code) with a note the\
   first time the message is received, but accept it the second time.\
\
2.5.6.  TempError\
\
   A "TempError" result means that the SPF client encountered a\
   transient error while performing the check.  Checking software can\
   choose to accept or temporarily reject the message.  If the message\
   is rejected during the SMTP transaction for this reason, the software\
   SHOULD use an SMTP reply code of 451 and, if supported, the 4.4.3 DSN\
   code.\
\
2.5.7.  PermError\
\
   A "PermError" result means that the domain's published records could\
   not be correctly interpreted.  This signals an error condition that\
   requires manual intervention to be resolved, as opposed to the\
   TempError result.  Be aware that if the domain owner uses macros\
   (Section 8), it is possible that this result is due to the checked\
   identities having an unexpected format.\
\
3.  SPF Records\
\
   An SPF record is a DNS Resource Record (RR) that declares which hosts\
   are, and are not, authorized to use a domain name for the "HELO" and\
   "MAIL FROM" identities.  Loosely, the record partitions all hosts\
   into permitted and not-permitted sets (though some hosts might fall\
   into neither category).\
\
\
\
Wong & Schlitt                Experimental                      [Page 9]\
\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   The SPF record is a single string of text.  An example record is the\
   following:\
\
      v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all\
\
   This record has a version of "spf1" and three directives: "+mx",\
   "a:colo.example.com/28" (the + is implied), and "-all".\
\
3.1.  Publishing\
\
   Domain owners wishing to be SPF compliant must publish SPF records\
   for the hosts that are used in the "MAIL FROM" and "HELO" identities.\
   The SPF records are placed in the DNS tree at the host name it\
   pertains to, not a subdomain under it, such as is done with SRV\
   records.  This is the same whether the TXT or SPF RR type (see\
   Section 3.1.1) is used.\
\
   The example above in Section 3 might be published via these lines in\
   a domain zone file:\
\
      example.com.          TXT "v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all"\
      smtp-out.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 a -all"\
\
   When publishing via TXT records, beware of other TXT records\
   published there for other purposes.  They may cause problems with\
   size limits (see Section 3.1.4).\
\
3.1.1.  DNS Resource Record Types\
\
   This document defines a new DNS RR of type SPF, code 99.  The format\
   of this type is identical to the TXT RR [RFC1035].  For either type,\
   the character content of the record is encoded as [US-ASCII].\
\
   It is recognized that the current practice (using a TXT record) is\
   not optimal, but it is necessary because there are a number of DNS\
   server and resolver implementations in common use that cannot handle\
   the new RR type.  The two-record-type scheme provides a forward path\
   to the better solution of using an RR type reserved for this purpose.\
\
   An SPF-compliant domain name SHOULD have SPF records of both RR\
   types.  A compliant domain name MUST have a record of at least one\
   type.  If a domain has records of both types, they MUST have\
   identical content.  For example, instead of publishing just one\
   record as in Section 3.1 above, it is better to publish:\
\
      example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all"\
      example.com. IN SPF "v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all"\

RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   Example RRs in this document are shown with the TXT record type;\
   however, they could be published with the SPF type or with both\
   types.\
\
3.1.2.  Multiple DNS Records\
\
   A domain name MUST NOT have multiple records that would cause an\
   authorization check to select more than one record.  See Section 4.5\
   for the selection rules.\
\
3.1.3.  Multiple Strings in a Single DNS record\
\
   As defined in [RFC1035] sections 3.3.14 and 3.3, a single text DNS\
   record (either TXT or SPF RR types) can be composed of more than one\
   string.  If a published record contains multiple strings, then the\
   record MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated together\
   without adding spaces.  For example:\
\
      IN TXT "v=spf1 .... first" "second string..."\
\
   MUST be treated as equivalent to\
\
      IN TXT "v=spf1 .... firstsecond string..."\
\
   SPF or TXT records containing multiple strings are useful in\
   constructing records that would exceed the 255-byte maximum length of\
   a string within a single TXT or SPF RR record.\
\
3.1.4.  Record Size\
\
   The published SPF record for a given domain name SHOULD remain small\
   enough that the results of a query for it will fit within 512 octets.\
   This will keep even older DNS implementations from falling over to\
   TCP.  Since the answer size is dependent on many things outside the\
   scope of this document, it is only possible to give this guideline:\
   If the combined length of the DNS name and the text of all the\
   records of a given type (TXT or SPF) is under 450 characters, then\
   DNS answers should fit in UDP packets.  Note that when computing the\
   sizes for queries of the TXT format, one must take into account any\
   other TXT records published at the domain name.  Records that are too\
   long to fit in a single UDP packet MAY be silently ignored by SPF\
   clients.\
\
3.1.5.  Wildcard Records\
\
   Use of wildcard records for publishing is not recommended.  Care must\
   be taken if wildcard records are used.  If a domain publishes\
   wildcard MX records, it may want to publish wildcard declarations,\
\
\
\

RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   subject to the same requirements and problems.  In particular, the\
   declaration must be repeated for any host that has any RR records at\
   all, and for subdomains thereof.  For example, the example given in\
   [RFC1034], Section 4.3.3, could be extended with the following:\
\
       X.COM.          MX      10      A.X.COM\
       X.COM.          TXT     "v=spf1 a:A.X.COM -all"\
\
       *.X.COM.        MX      10      A.X.COM\
       *.X.COM.        TXT     "v=spf1 a:A.X.COM -all"\
\
       A.X.COM.        A       1.2.3.4\
       A.X.COM.        MX      10      A.X.COM\
       A.X.COM.        TXT     "v=spf1 a:A.X.COM -all"\
\
       *.A.X.COM.      MX      10      A.X.COM\
       *.A.X.COM.      TXT     "v=spf1 a:A.X.COM -all"\
\
   Notice that SPF records must be repeated twice for every name within\
   the domain: once for the name, and once with a wildcard to cover the\
   tree under the name.\
\
   Use of wildcards is discouraged in general as they cause every name\
   under the domain to exist and queries against arbitrary names will\
   never return RCODE 3 (Name Error).\
\
4.  The check_host() Function\
\
   The check_host() function fetches SPF records, parses them, and\
   interprets them to determine whether a particular host is or is not\
   permitted to send mail with a given identity.  Mail receivers that\
   perform this check MUST correctly evaluate the check_host() function\
   as described here.\
\
   Implementations MAY use a different algorithm than the canonical\
   algorithm defined here, so long as the results are the same in all\
   cases.\
\
4.1.  Arguments\
\
   The check_host() function takes these arguments:\
\
   <ip>     - the IP address of the SMTP client that is emitting the\
              mail, either IPv4 or IPv6.\
\
   <domain> - the domain that provides the sought-after authorization\
              information; initially, the domain portion of the "MAIL\
              FROM" or "HELO" identity.\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   <sender> - the "MAIL FROM" or "HELO" identity.\
\
   The domain portion of <sender> will usually be the same as the\
   <domain> argument when check_host() is initially evaluated.  However,\
   this will generally not be true for recursive evaluations (see\
   Section 5.2 below).\
\
   Actual implementations of the check_host() function may need\
   additional arguments.\
\
4.2.  Results\
\
   The function check_host() can return one of several results described\
   in Section 2.5.  Based on the result, the action to be taken is\
   determined by the local policies of the receiver.\
\
4.3.  Initial Processing\
\
   If the <domain> is malformed (label longer than 63 characters, zero-\
   length label not at the end, etc.) or is not a fully qualified domain\
   name, or if the DNS lookup returns "domain does not exist" (RCODE 3),\
   check_host() immediately returns the result "None".\
\
   If the <sender> has no localpart, substitute the string "postmaster"\
   for the localpart.\
\
4.4.  Record Lookup\
\
   In accordance with how the records are published (see Section 3.1\
   above), a DNS query needs to be made for the <domain> name, querying\
   for either RR type TXT, SPF, or both.  If both SPF and TXT RRs are\
   looked up, the queries MAY be done in parallel.\
\
   If all DNS lookups that are made return a server failure (RCODE 2),\
   or other error (RCODE other than 0 or 3), or time out, then\
   check_host() exits immediately with the result "TempError".\
\
4.5.  Selecting Records\
\
   Records begin with a version section:\
\
   record           = version terms *SP\
   version          = "v=spf1"\
\
   Starting with the set of records that were returned by the lookup,\
   record selection proceeds in two steps:\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   1. Records that do not begin with a version section of exactly\
      "v=spf1" are discarded.  Note that the version section is\
      terminated either by an SP character or the end of the record.  A\
      record with a version section of "v=spf10" does not match and must\
      be discarded.\
\
   2. If any records of type SPF are in the set, then all records of\
      type TXT are discarded.\
\
   After the above steps, there should be exactly one record remaining\
   and evaluation can proceed.  If there are two or more records\
   remaining, then check_host() exits immediately with the result of\
   "PermError".\
\
   If no matching records are returned, an SPF client MUST assume that\
   the domain makes no SPF declarations.  SPF processing MUST stop and\
   return "None".\
\
4.6.  Record Evaluation\
\
   After one SPF record has been selected, the check_host() function\
   parses and interprets it to find a result for the current test.  If\
   there are any syntax errors, check_host() returns immediately with\
   the result "PermError".\
\
   Implementations MAY choose to parse the entire record first and\
   return "PermError" if the record is not syntactically well formed.\
   However, in all cases, any syntax errors anywhere in the record MUST\
   be detected.\
\
4.6.1.  Term Evaluation\
\
   There are two types of terms: mechanisms and modifiers.  A record\
   contains an ordered list of these as specified in the following\
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF).\
\
   terms            = *( 1*SP ( directive / modifier ) )\
\
   directive        = [ qualifier ] mechanism\
   qualifier        = "+" / "-" / "?" / "~"\
   mechanism        = ( all / include\
                      / A / MX / PTR / IP4 / IP6 / exists )\
   modifier         = redirect / explanation / unknown-modifier\
   unknown-modifier = name "=" macro-string\
\
   name             = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "." )\
\
   Most mechanisms allow a ":" or "/" character after the name.\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   Modifiers always contain an equals ('=') character immediately after\
   the name, and before any ":" or "/" characters that may be part of\
   the macro-string.\
\
   Terms that do not contain any of "=", ":", or "/" are mechanisms, as\
   defined in Section 5.\
\
   As per the definition of the ABNF notation in [RFC4234], mechanism\
   and modifier names are case-insensitive.\
\
4.6.2.  Mechanisms\
\
   Each mechanism is considered in turn from left to right.  If there\
   are no more mechanisms, the result is specified in Section 4.7.\
\
   When a mechanism is evaluated, one of three things can happen: it can\
   match, not match, or throw an exception.\
\
   If it matches, processing ends and the qualifier value is returned as\
   the result of that record.  If it does not match, processing\
   continues with the next mechanism.  If it throws an exception,\
   mechanism processing ends and the exception value is returned.\
\
   The possible qualifiers, and the results they return are as follows:\
\
      "+" Pass\
      "-" Fail\
      "~" SoftFail\
      "?" Neutral\
\
   The qualifier is optional and defaults to "+".\
\
   When a mechanism matches and the qualifier is "-", then a "Fail"\
   result is returned and the explanation string is computed as\
   described in Section 6.2.\
\
   The specific mechanisms are described in Section 5.\
\
4.6.3.  Modifiers\
\
   Modifiers are not mechanisms: they do not return match or not-match.\
   Instead they provide additional information.  Although modifiers do\
   not directly affect the evaluation of the record, the "redirect"\
   modifier has an effect after all the mechanisms have been evaluated.\
\
\

\
\
4.7.  Default Result\
\
   If none of the mechanisms match and there is no "redirect" modifier,\
   then the check_host() returns a result of "Neutral", just as if\
   "?all" were specified as the last directive.  If there is a\
   "redirect" modifier, check_host() proceeds as defined in Section 6.1.\
\
   Note that records SHOULD always use either a "redirect" modifier or\
   an "all" mechanism to explicitly terminate processing.\
\
   For example:\
\
      v=spf1 +mx -all\
   or\
      v=spf1 +mx redirect=_spf.example.com\
\
4.8.  Domain Specification\
\
   Several of these mechanisms and modifiers have a <domain-spec>\
   section.  The <domain-spec> string is macro expanded (see Section 8).\
   The resulting string is the common presentation form of a fully-\
   qualified DNS name: a series of labels separated by periods.  This\
   domain is called the <target-name> in the rest of this document.\
\
   Note: The result of the macro expansion is not subject to any further\
   escaping.  Hence, this facility cannot produce all characters that\
   are legal in a DNS label (e.g., the control characters).  However,\
   this facility is powerful enough to express legal host names and\
   common utility labels (such as "_spf") that are used in DNS.\
\
   For several mechanisms, the <domain-spec> is optional.  If it is not\
   provided, the <domain> is used as the <target-name>.\
\
5.  Mechanism Definitions\
\
   This section defines two types of mechanisms.\
\
   Basic mechanisms contribute to the language framework.  They do not\
   specify a particular type of authorization scheme.\
\
      all\
      include\
\
   Designated sender mechanisms are used to designate a set of <ip>\
   addresses as being permitted or not permitted to use the <domain> for\
   sending mail.\
\
\
\
\
\

\
\
      a\
      mx\
      ptr\
      ip4\
      ip6\
      exists\
\
   The following conventions apply to all mechanisms that perform a\
   comparison between <ip> and an IP address at any point:\
\
   If no CIDR-length is given in the directive, then <ip> and the IP\
   address are compared for equality. (Here, CIDR is Classless Inter-\
   Domain Routing.)\
\
   If a CIDR-length is specified, then only the specified number of\
   high-order bits of <ip> and the IP address are compared for equality.\
\
   When any mechanism fetches host addresses to compare with <ip>, when\
   <ip> is an IPv4 address, A records are fetched, when <ip> is an IPv6\
   address, AAAA records are fetched.  Even if the SMTP connection is\
   via IPv6, an IPv4-mapped IPv6 IP address (see [RFC3513], Section\
   2.5.5) MUST still be considered an IPv4 address.\
\
   Several mechanisms rely on information fetched from DNS.  For these\
   DNS queries, except where noted, if the DNS server returns an error\
   (RCODE other than 0 or 3) or the query times out, the mechanism\
   throws the exception "TempError".  If the server returns "domain does\
   not exist" (RCODE 3), then evaluation of the mechanism continues as\
   if the server returned no error (RCODE 0) and zero answer records.\
\
5.1.  "all"\
\
   all              = "all"\
\
   The "all" mechanism is a test that always matches.  It is used as the\
   rightmost mechanism in a record to provide an explicit default.\
\
   For example:\
\
      v=spf1 a mx -all\
\
   Mechanisms after "all" will never be tested.  Any "redirect" modifier\
   (Section 6.1) has no effect when there is an "all" mechanism.\

\
\
5.2.  "include"\
\
      include          = "include"  ":" domain-spec\
\
   The "include" mechanism triggers a recursive evaluation of\
   check_host().  The domain-spec is expanded as per Section 8.  Then\
   check_host() is evaluated with the resulting string as the <domain>.\
   The <ip> and <sender> arguments remain the same as in the current\
   evaluation of check_host().\
\
   In hindsight, the name "include" was poorly chosen.  Only the\
   evaluated result of the referenced SPF record is used, rather than\
   acting as if the referenced SPF record was literally included in the\
   first.  For example, evaluating a "-all" directive in the referenced\
   record does not terminate the overall processing and does not\
   necessarily result in an overall "Fail".  (Better names for this\
   mechanism would have been "if-pass", "on-pass", etc.)\
\
   The "include" mechanism makes it possible for one domain to designate\
   multiple administratively-independent domains.  For example, a vanity\
   domain "example.net" might send mail using the servers of\
   administratively-independent domains example.com and example.org.\
\
   Example.net could say\
\
      IN TXT "v=spf1 include:example.com include:example.org -all"\
\
   This would direct check_host() to, in effect, check the records of\
   example.com and example.org for a "Pass" result.  Only if the host\
   were not permitted for either of those domains would the result be\
   "Fail".\

\
   The "include" mechanism is intended for crossing administrative\
   boundaries.  Although it is possible to use includes to consolidate\
   multiple domains that share the same set of designated hosts, domains\
   are encouraged to use redirects where possible, and to minimize the\
   number of includes within a single administrative domain.  For\
   example, if example.com and example.org were managed by the same\
   entity, and if the permitted set of hosts for both domains was\
   "mx:example.com", it would be possible for example.org to specify\
   "include:example.com", but it would be preferable to specify\
   "redirect=example.com" or even "mx:example.com".\

   to the returned address(es).  If any address matches, the mechanism\
   matches.\

   check_host() first performs an MX lookup on the <target-name>.  Then\
   it performs an address lookup on each MX name returned.  The <ip> is\
   compared to each returned IP address.  To prevent Denial of Service\
   (DoS) attacks, more than 10 MX names MUST NOT be looked up during the\
   evaluation of an "mx" mechanism (see Section 10).  If any address\
   matches, the mechanism matches.\
\
   Note regarding implicit MXs: If the <target-name> has no MX records,\
   check_host() MUST NOT pretend the target is its single MX, and MUST\
   NOT default to an A lookup on the <target-name> directly.  This\
   behavior breaks with the legacy "implicit MX" rule.  See [RFC2821],\
   Section 5.  If such behavior is desired, the publisher should specify\
   an "a" directive.\
\
5.5.  "ptr"\
\
   This mechanism tests whether the DNS reverse-mapping for <ip> exists\
   and correctly points to a domain name within a particular domain.\
\
   PTR              = "ptr"    [ ":" domain-spec ]\
\
   First, the <ip>'s name is looked up using this procedure: perform a\
   DNS reverse-mapping for <ip>, looking up the corresponding PTR record\
   in "in-addr.arpa." if the address is an IPv4 one and in "ip6.arpa."\
   if it is an IPv6 address.  For each record returned, validate the\
   domain name by looking up its IP address.  To prevent DoS attacks,\
   more than 10 PTR names MUST NOT be looked up during the evaluation of\
   a "ptr" mechanism (see Section 10).  If <ip> is among the returned IP\
   addresses, then that domain name is validated.  In pseudocode:\
\
   sending-domain_names := ptr_lookup(sending-host_IP); if more than 10\
   sending-domain_names are found, use at most 10.  for each name in\
   (sending-domain_names) {\
     IP_addresses := a_lookup(name);\
     if the sending-domain_IP is one of the IP_addresses {\
       validated-sending-domain_names += name;\
     } }\
\
   Check all validated domain names to see if they end in the\
   <target-name> domain.  If any do, this mechanism matches.  If no\
   validated domain name can be found, or if none of the validated\

\
\
   domain names end in the <target-name>, this mechanism fails to match.\
   If a DNS error occurs while doing the PTR RR lookup, then this\
   mechanism fails to match.  If a DNS error occurs while doing an A RR\
   lookup, then that domain name is skipped and the search continues.\
\
   Pseudocode:\
\
   for each name in (validated-sending-domain_names) {\
     if name ends in <domain-spec>, return match.\
     if name is <domain-spec>, return match.\
   }\
   return no-match.\
\
   This mechanism matches if the <target-name> is either an ancestor of\
   a validated domain name or if the <target-name> and a validated\
   domain name are the same.  For example: "mail.example.com" is within\
   the domain "example.com", but "mail.bad-example.com" is not.\
\
   Note: Use of this mechanism is discouraged because it is slow, it is\
   not as reliable as other mechanisms in cases of DNS errors, and it\
   places a large burden on the arpa name servers.  If used, proper PTR\
   records must be in place for the domain's hosts and the "ptr"\
   mechanism should be one of the last mechanisms checked.\
\
5.6.  "ip4" and "ip6"\
\
   These mechanisms test whether <ip> is contained within a given IP\
   network.\
\
   IP4              = "ip4"      ":" ip4-network   [ ip4-cidr-length ]\
   IP6              = "ip6"      ":" ip6-network   [ ip6-cidr-length ]\
\
   ip4-cidr-length  = "/" 1*DIGIT\
   ip6-cidr-length  = "/" 1*DIGIT\
   dual-cidr-length = [ ip4-cidr-length ] [ "/" ip6-cidr-length ]\
\
   ip4-network      = qnum "." qnum "." qnum "." qnum\
   qnum             = DIGIT                 ; 0-9\
                      / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99\
                      / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199\
                      / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249\
                      / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255\
            ; as per conventional dotted quad notation.  e.g., 192.0.2.0\
   ip6-network      = <as per [RFC 3513], section 2.2>\
            ; e.g., 2001:DB8::CD30\
\
   The <ip> is compared to the given network.  If CIDR-length high-order\
   bits match, the mechanism matches.\

\
\
   If ip4-cidr-length is omitted, it is taken to be "/32".  If\
   ip6-cidr-length is omitted, it is taken to be "/128".  It is not\
   permitted to omit parts of the IP address instead of using CIDR\
   notations.  That is, use 192.0.2.0/24 instead of 192.0.2.\
\
5.7.  "exists"\
\
   This mechanism is used to construct an arbitrary domain name that is\
   used for a DNS A record query.  It allows for complicated schemes\
   involving arbitrary parts of the mail envelope to determine what is\
   permitted.\
\
   exists           = "exists"   ":" domain-spec\
\
   The domain-spec is expanded as per Section 8.  The resulting domain\
   name is used for a DNS A RR lookup.  If any A record is returned,\
   this mechanism matches.  The lookup type is A even when the\
   connection type is IPv6.\
\
   Domains can use this mechanism to specify arbitrarily complex\
   queries.  For example, suppose example.com publishes the record:\
\
      v=spf1 exists:%{ir}.%{l1r+-}._spf.%{d} -all\
\
   The <target-name> might expand to\
   "1.2.0.192.someuser._spf.example.com".  This makes fine-grained\
   decisions possible at the level of the user and client IP address.\
\
   This mechanism enables queries that mimic the style of tests that\
   existing anti-spam DNS blacklists (DNSBL) use.\
\
6.  Modifier Definitions\
\
   Modifiers are name/value pairs that provide additional information.\
   Modifiers always have an "=" separating the name and the value.\
\
   The modifiers defined in this document ("redirect" and "exp") MAY\
   appear anywhere in the record, but SHOULD appear at the end, after\
   all mechanisms.  Ordering of these two modifiers does not matter.\
   These two modifiers MUST NOT appear in a record more than once each.\
   If they do, then check_host() exits with a result of "PermError".\
\
   Unrecognized modifiers MUST be ignored no matter where in a record,\
   or how often.  This allows implementations of this document to\
   gracefully handle records with modifiers that are defined in other\
   specifications.\
\

\
\
6.1.  redirect: Redirected Query\
\
   If all mechanisms fail to match, and a "redirect" modifier is\
   present, then processing proceeds as follows:\
\
   redirect         = "redirect" "=" domain-spec\
\
   The domain-spec portion of the redirect section is expanded as per\
   the macro rules in Section 8.  Then check_host() is evaluated with\
   the resulting string as the <domain>.  The <ip> and <sender>\
   arguments remain the same as current evaluation of check_host().\
\
   The result of this new evaluation of check_host() is then considered\
   the result of the current evaluation with the exception that if no\
   SPF record is found, or if the target-name is malformed, the result\
   is a "PermError" rather than "None".\
\
   Note that the newly-queried domain may itself specify redirect\
   processing.\
\
   This facility is intended for use by organizations that wish to apply\
   the same record to multiple domains.  For example:\
\
     la.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"\
     ny.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"\
     sf.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"\
   _spf.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 mx:example.com -all"\
\
   In this example, mail from any of the three domains is described by\
   the same record.  This can be an administrative advantage.\
\
   Note: In general, the domain "A" cannot reliably use a redirect to\
   another domain "B" not under the same administrative control.  Since\
   the <sender> stays the same, there is no guarantee that the record at\
   domain "B" will correctly work for mailboxes in domain "A",\
   especially if domain "B" uses mechanisms involving localparts.  An\
   "include" directive may be more appropriate.\
\
   For clarity, it is RECOMMENDED that any "redirect" modifier appear as\
   the very last term in a record.\
\
6.2.  exp: Explanation\
\
   explanation      = "exp" "=" domain-spec\
\
   If check_host() results in a "Fail" due to a mechanism match (such as\
   "-all"), and the "exp" modifier is present, then the explanation\
   string returned is computed as described below.  If no "exp" modifier\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   is present, then either a default explanation string or an empty\
   explanation string may be returned.\
\
   The <domain-spec> is macro expanded (see Section 8) and becomes the\
   <target-name>.  The DNS TXT record for the <target-name> is fetched.\
\
   If <domain-spec> is empty, or there are any DNS processing errors\
   (any RCODE other than 0), or if no records are returned, or if more\
   than one record is returned, or if there are syntax errors in the\
   explanation string, then proceed as if no exp modifier was given.\
\
   The fetched TXT record's strings are concatenated with no spaces, and\
   then treated as an <explain-string>, which is macro-expanded.  This\
   final result is the explanation string.  Implementations MAY limit\
   the length of the resulting explanation string to allow for other\
   protocol constraints and/or reasonable processing limits.  Since the\
   explanation string is intended for an SMTP response and [RFC2821]\
   Section 2.4 says that responses are in [US-ASCII], the explanation\
   string is also limited to US-ASCII.\
\
   Software evaluating check_host() can use this string to communicate\
   information from the publishing domain in the form of a short message\
   or URL.  Software SHOULD make it clear that the explanation string\
   comes from a third party.  For example, it can prepend the macro\
   string "%{o} explains: " to the explanation, such as shown in Section\
   2.5.4.\
\
   Suppose example.com has this record:\
\
      v=spf1 mx -all exp=explain._spf.%{d}\
\
   Here are some examples of possible explanation TXT records at\
   explain._spf.example.com:\
\
      "Mail from example.com should only be sent by its own servers."\
         -- a simple, constant message\
\
      "%{i} is not one of %{d}'s designated mail servers."\
         -- a message with a little more information, including the IP\
            address that failed the check\
\
      "See http://%{d}/why.html?s=%{S}&i=%{I}"\
         -- a complicated example that constructs a URL with the\
            arguments to check_host() so that a web page can be\
            generated with detailed, custom instructions\
\
   Note: During recursion into an "include" mechanism, an exp= modifier\
   from the <target-name> MUST NOT be used.  In contrast, when executing\

   a "redirect" modifier, an exp= modifier from the original domain MUST\
   NOT be used.\
\
7.  The Received-SPF Header Field\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that SMTP receivers record the result of SPF\
   processing in the message header.  If an SMTP receiver chooses to do\
   so, it SHOULD use the "Received-SPF" header field defined here for\
   each identity that was checked.  This information is intended for the\
   recipient.  (Information intended for the sender is described in\
   Section 6.2, Explanation.)\
\
   The Received-SPF header field is a trace field (see [RFC2822] Section\
   3.6.7) and SHOULD be prepended to the existing header, above the\
   Received: field that is generated by the SMTP receiver.  It MUST\
   appear above all other Received-SPF fields in the message.  The\
   header field has the following format:\
\
   header-field     = "Received-SPF:" [CFWS] result FWS [comment FWS]\
                      [ key-value-list ] CRLF\
\
   result           = "Pass" / "Fail" / "SoftFail" / "Neutral" /\
                      "None" / "TempError" / "PermError"\
\
   key-value-list   = key-value-pair *( ";" [CFWS] key-value-pair )\
                      [";"]\
\
   key-value-pair   = key [CFWS] "=" ( dot-atom / quoted-string )\
\
   key              = "client-ip" / "envelope-from" / "helo" /\
                      "problem" / "receiver" / "identity" /\
                       mechanism / "x-" name / name\
\
   identity         = "mailfrom"   ; for the "MAIL FROM" identity\
                      / "helo"     ; for the "HELO" identity\
                      / name       ; other identities\
\
   dot-atom         = <unquoted word as per [RFC2822]>\
   quoted-string    = <quoted string as per [RFC2822]>\
   comment          = <comment string as per [RFC2822]>\
   CFWS             = <comment or folding white space as per [RFC2822]>\
   FWS              = <folding white space as per [RFC2822]>\
   CRLF             = <standard end-of-line token as per [RFC2822]>\
\
   The header field SHOULD include a "(...)" style <comment> after the\
   result, conveying supporting information for the result, such as\
   <ip>, <sender>, and <domain>.\

   The following key-value pairs are designed for later machine parsing.\
   SPF clients SHOULD give enough information so that the SPF results\
   can be verified.  That is, at least "client-ip", "helo", and, if the\
   "MAIL FROM" identity was checked, "envelope-from".\
\
   client-ip      the IP address of the SMTP client\
\
   envelope-from  the envelope sender mailbox\
\
   helo           the host name given in the HELO or EHLO command\
\
   mechanism      the mechanism that matched (if no mechanisms matched,\
                  substitute the word "default")\
\
   problem        if an error was returned, details about the error\
\
   receiver       the host name of the SPF client\
\
   identity       the identity that was checked; see the <identity> ABNF\
                  rule\
\
   Other keys may be defined by SPF clients.  Until a new key name\
   becomes widely accepted, new key names should start with "x-".\
\
   SPF clients MUST make sure that the Received-SPF header field does\
   not contain invalid characters, is not excessively long, and does not\
   contain malicious data that has been provided by the sender.\
\
   Examples of various header styles that could be generated are the\
   following:\
\
   Received-SPF: Pass (mybox.example.org: domain of\
    myname@example.com designates 192.0.2.1 as permitted sender)\
       receiver=mybox.example.org; client-ip=192.0.2.1;\
       envelope-from=<myname@example.com>; helo=foo.example.com;\
\
   Received-SPF: Fail (mybox.example.org: domain of\
                     myname@example.com does not designate\
                     192.0.2.1 as permitted sender)\
                     identity=mailfrom; client-ip=192.0.2.1;\

   macro-literal    = %x21-24 / %x26-7E\

   macro-letter     = "s" / "l" / "o" / "d" / "i" / "p" / "h" /\
                      "c" / "r" / "t"\
   transformers     = *DIGIT [ "r" ]\
   delimiter        = "." / "-" / "+" / "," / "/" / "_" / "="\
\
   A literal "%" is expressed by "%%".\
\
      "%_" expands to a single " " space.\
      "%-" expands to a URL-encoded space, viz., "%20".\
\
   The following macro letters are expanded in term arguments:\
\
      s = <sender>\
      l = local-part of <sender>\
      o = domain of <sender>\
      d = <domain>\
      i = <ip>\
      p = the validated domain name of <ip>\
      v = the string "in-addr" if <ip> is ipv4, or "ip6" if <ip> is ipv6\
      h = HELO/EHLO domain\

   The following macro letters are allowed only in "exp" text:\
\
      c = SMTP client IP (easily readable format)\
      r = domain name of host performing the check\
      t = current timestamp\
\
   A '%' character not followed by a '{', '%', '-', or '_' character is\
   a syntax error.  So\
\
      -exists:%(ir).sbl.spamhaus.example.org\
\
   is incorrect and will cause check_host() to return a "PermError".\
   Instead, say\
\
      -exists:%{ir}.sbl.spamhaus.example.org\
\
   Optional transformers are the following:\
\
      *DIGIT = zero or more digits\
      'r'    = reverse value, splitting on dots by default\
\
   If transformers or delimiters are provided, the replacement value for\
   a macro letter is split into parts.  After performing any reversal\
   operation and/or removal of left-hand parts, the parts are rejoined\
   using "." and not the original splitting characters.\
\
   By default, strings are split on "." (dots).  Note that no special\
   treatment is given to leading, trailing, or consecutive delimiters,\
   and so the list of parts may contain empty strings.  Older\
   implementations of SPF prohibit trailing dots in domain names, so\
   trailing dots should not be published by domain owners, although they\
   must be accepted by implementations conforming to this document.\
   Macros may specify delimiter characters that are used instead of ".".\
\
   The 'r' transformer indicates a reversal operation: if the client IP\
   address were 192.0.2.1, the macro %{i} would expand to "192.0.2.1"\
   and the macro %{ir} would expand to "1.2.0.192".\
\
   The DIGIT transformer indicates the number of right-hand parts to\
   use, after optional reversal.  If a DIGIT is specified, the value\
   MUST be nonzero.  If no DIGITs are specified, or if the value\
   specifies more parts than are available, all the available parts are\
   used.  If the DIGIT was 5, and only 3 parts were available, the macro\
   interpreter would pretend the DIGIT was 3.  Implementations MUST\
   support at least a value of 128, as that is the maximum number of\
   labels in a domain name.\

   The "s" macro expands to the <sender> argument.  It is an E-Mail\
   address with a localpart, an "@" character, and a domain.  The "l"\

   2.2.  It is intended for humans to read.\
\
   The "p" macro expands to the validated domain name of <ip>.  The\
   procedure for finding the validated domain name is defined in Section\
   5.5.  If the <domain> is present in the list of validated domains, it\
   SHOULD be used.  Otherwise, if a subdomain of the <domain> is\
   present, it SHOULD be used.  Otherwise, any name from the list may be\
   used.  If there are no validated domain names or if a DNS error\
   occurs, the string "unknown" is used.\
\
   The "r" macro expands to the name of the receiving MTA.  This SHOULD\
   be a fully qualified domain name, but if one does not exist (as when\
   the checking is done by a MUA) or if policy restrictions dictate\
   otherwise, the word "unknown" SHOULD be substituted.  The domain name\
   may be different from the name found in the MX record that the client\
   MTA used to locate the receiving MTA.\
\
   The "t" macro expands to the decimal representation of the\
   approximate number of seconds since the Epoch (Midnight, January 1,\
   1970, UTC).  This is the same value as is returned by the POSIX\
   time() function in most standards-compliant libraries.\
\
   When the result of macro expansion is used in a domain name query, if\
   the expanded domain name exceeds 253 characters (the maximum length\
   of a domain name), the left side is truncated to fit, by removing\
   successive domain labels until the total length does not exceed 253\
   characters.\
\
   Uppercased macros expand exactly as their lowercased equivalents, and\
   are then URL escaped.  URL escaping must be performed for characters\
   not in the "uric" set, which is defined in [RFC3986].\

\
\
   Note: Care must be taken so that macro expansion for legitimate\
   E-Mail does not exceed the 63-character limit on DNS labels.  The\
   localpart of E-Mail addresses, in particular, can have more than 63\
   characters between dots.\
\
   Note: Domains should avoid using the "s", "l", "o", or "h" macros in\
   conjunction with any mechanism directive.  Although these macros are\
   powerful and allow per-user records to be published, they severely\
   limit the ability of implementations to cache results of check_host()\
   and they reduce the effectiveness of DNS caches.\
\
   Implementations should be aware that if no directive processed during\
   the evaluation of check_host() contains an "s", "l", "o", or "h"\
   macro, then the results of the evaluation can be cached on the basis\
   of <domain> and <ip> alone for as long as the shortest Time To Live\
   (TTL) of all the DNS records involved.\

9.  Implications\
\
   This section outlines the major implications that adoption of this\
   document will have on various entities involved in Internet E-Mail.\
   It is intended to make clear to the reader where this document\
   knowingly affects the operation of such entities.  This section is\
   not a "how-to" manual, or a "best practices" document, and it is not\
   a comprehensive list of what such entities should do in light of this\
   document.\
\
   This section is non-normative.\
\
9.1.  Sending Domains\
\
   Domains that wish to be compliant with this specification will need\
   to determine the list of hosts that they allow to use their domain\
   name in the "HELO" and "MAIL FROM" identities.  It is recognized that\
   forming such a list is not just a simple technical exercise, but\
   involves policy decisions with both technical and administrative\
   considerations.\
\
   It can be helpful to publish records that include a "tracking\
   exists:" mechanism.  By looking at the name server logs, a rough list\
   may then be generated.  For example:\
\
      v=spf1 exists:_h.%{h}._l.%{l}._o.%{o}._i.%{i}._spf.%{d} ?all\
\

RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
9.2.  Mailing Lists\
\
   Mailing lists must be aware of how they re-inject mail that is sent\
   to the list.  Mailing lists MUST comply with the requirements in\
   [RFC2821], Section 3.10, and [RFC1123], Section 5.3.6, that say that\
   the reverse-path MUST be changed to be the mailbox of a person or\
   other entity who administers the list.  Whereas the reasons for\
   changing the reverse-path are many and long-standing, SPF adds\
   enforcement to this requirement.\
\
   In practice, almost all mailing list software in use already complies\
   with this requirement.  Mailing lists that do not comply may or may\
   not encounter problems depending on how access to the list is\
   restricted.  Such lists that are entirely internal to a domain (only\
   people in the domain can send to or receive from the list) are not\
   affected.\
\
9.3.  Forwarding Services and Aliases\
\
   Forwarding services take mail that is received at a mailbox and\
   direct it to some external mailbox.  At the time of this writing, the\
   near-universal practice of such services is to use the original "MAIL\
   FROM" of a message when re-injecting it for delivery to the external\
   mailbox.  [RFC1123] and [RFC2821] describe this action as an "alias"\
   rather than a "mail list".  This means that the external mailbox's\
   MTA sees all such mail in a connection from a host of the forwarding\
   service, and so the "MAIL FROM" identity will not, in general, pass\
   authorization.\
\
   There are three places that techniques can be used to ameliorate this\
   problem.\
\
   1. The beginning, when E-Mail is first sent.\
\
       1. "Neutral" results could be given for IP addresses that may be\
          forwarders, instead of "Fail" results.  For example:\
\
             "v=spf1 mx -exists:%{ir}.sbl.spamhaus.example.org ?all"\
\
          This would cause a lookup on an anti-spam DNS blacklist\
          (DNSBL) and cause a result of "Fail" only for E-Mail coming\
          from listed sources.  All other E-Mail, including E-Mail sent\
          through forwarders, would receive a "Neutral" result.  By\
          checking the DNSBL after the known good sources, problems with\
          incorrect listing on the DNSBL are greatly reduced.\
\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
       2. The "MAIL FROM" identity could have additional information in\
          the localpart that cryptographically identifies the mail as\
          coming from an authorized source.  In this case, such an SPF\
          record could be used:\
\
             "v=spf1 mx exists:%{l}._spf_verify.%{d} -all"\
\
          Then, a specialized DNS server can be set up to serve the\
          _spf_verify subdomain that validates the localpart.  Although\
          this requires an extra DNS lookup, this happens only when the\
          E-Mail would otherwise be rejected as not coming from a known\
          good source.\
\
          Note that due to the 63-character limit for domain labels,\
          this approach only works reliably if the localpart signature\
          scheme is guaranteed either to only produce localparts with a\
          maximum of 63 characters or to gracefully handle truncated\
          localparts.\
\
       3. Similarly, a specialized DNS server could be set up that will\
          rate-limit the E-Mail coming from unexpected IP addresses.\
\
             "v=spf1 mx exists:%{ir}._spf_rate.%{d} -all"\
\
       4. SPF allows the creation of per-user policies for special\
          cases.  For example, the following SPF record and appropriate\
          wildcard DNS records can be used:\
\
                 "v=spf1 mx redirect=%{l1r+}._at_.%{o}._spf.%{d}"\
\
   2.  The middle, when E-Mail is forwarded.\
\
       1. Forwarding services can solve the problem by rewriting the\
          "MAIL FROM" to be in their own domain.  This means that mail\
          bounced from the external mailbox will have to be re-bounced\
          by the forwarding service.  Various schemes to do this exist\
          though they vary widely in complexity and resource\
          requirements on the part of the forwarding service.\
\
       2. Several popular MTAs can be forced from "alias" semantics to\
          "mailing list" semantics by configuring an additional alias\
          with "owner-" prepended to the original alias name (e.g., an\
          alias of "friends: george@example.com, fred@example.org" would\
          need another alias of the form "owner-friends:  localowner").\

\
\
   3. The end, when E-Mail is received.\
\
       1. If the owner of the external mailbox wishes to trust the\
          forwarding service, he can direct the external mailbox's MTA\
          to skip SPF tests when the client host belongs to the\
          forwarding service.\
\
       2. Tests against other identities, such as the "HELO" identity,\
          may be used to override a failed test against the "MAIL FROM"\
          identity.\
\
       3. For larger domains, it may not be possible to have a complete\
          or accurate list of forwarding services used by the owners of\
          the domain's mailboxes.  In such cases, whitelists of\
          generally-recognized forwarding services could be employed.\
\
9.4.  Mail Services\
\
   Service providers that offer mail services to third-party domains,\
   such as sending of bulk mail, may want to adjust their setup in light\
   of the authorization check described in this document.  If the "MAIL\
   FROM" identity used for such E-Mail uses the domain of the service\
   provider, then the provider needs only to ensure that its sending\
   host is authorized by its own SPF record, if any.\
\
   If the "MAIL FROM" identity does not use the mail service provider's\
   domain, then extra care must be taken.  The SPF record format has\
   several options for the third-party domain to authorize the service\
   provider's MTAs to send mail on its behalf.  For mail service\
   providers, such as ISPs, that have a wide variety of customers using\
   the same MTA, steps should be taken to prevent cross-customer forgery\
   (see Section 10.4).\
\
9.5.  MTA Relays\
\
   The authorization check generally precludes the use of arbitrary MTA\
   relays between sender and receiver of an E-Mail message.\
\
   Within an organization, MTA relays can be effectively deployed.\
   However, for purposes of this document, such relays are effectively\
   transparent.  The SPF authorization check is a check between border\
   MTAs of different domains.\
\
   For mail senders, this means that published SPF records must\
   authorize any MTAs that actually send across the Internet.  Usually,\
   these are just the border MTAs as internal MTAs simply forward mail\
   to these MTAs for delivery.\
\
\
\
\
Wong & Schlitt                Experimental                     [Page 34]\
\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   Mail receivers will generally want to perform the authorization check\
   at the border MTAs, specifically including all secondary MXs.  This\
   allows mail that fails to be rejected during the SMTP session rather\
   than bounced.  Internal MTAs then do not perform the authorization\
   test.  To perform the authorization test other than at the border,\
   the host that first transferred the message to the organization must\
   be determined, which can be difficult to extract from the message\
   header.  Testing other than at the border is not recommended.\
\
10.  Security Considerations\
\
10.1.  Processing Limits\
\
   As with most aspects of E-Mail, there are a number of ways that\
   malicious parties could use the protocol as an avenue for a\
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  The processing limits outlined here\
   are designed to prevent attacks such as the following:\
\
   o  A malicious party could create an SPF record with many references\
      to a victim's domain and send many E-Mails to different SPF\
      clients; those SPF clients would then create a DoS attack.  In\
      effect, the SPF clients are being used to amplify the attacker's\
      bandwidth by using fewer bytes in the SMTP session than are used\
      by the DNS queries.  Using SPF clients also allows the attacker to\
      hide the true source of the attack.\
\
   o  Whereas implementations of check_host() are supposed to limit the\
      number of DNS lookups, malicious domains could publish records\
      that exceed these limits in an attempt to waste computation effort\
      at their targets when they send them mail.  Malicious domains\
      could also design SPF records that cause particular\
      implementations to use excessive memory or CPU usage, or to\
      trigger bugs.\
\
   o  Malicious parties could send a large volume of mail purporting to\
      come from the intended target to a wide variety of legitimate mail\
      hosts.  These legitimate machines would then present a DNS load on\
      the target as they fetched the relevant records.\
\
   Of these, the case of a third party referenced in the SPF record is\
   the easiest for a DoS attack to effectively exploit.  As a result,\
   limits that may seem reasonable for an individual mail server can\
   still allow an unreasonable amount of bandwidth amplification.\
   Therefore, the processing limits need to be quite low.\
\
   SPF implementations MUST limit the number of mechanisms and modifiers\
   that do DNS lookups to at most 10 per SPF check, including any\
   lookups caused by the use of the "include" mechanism or the\
\
\

\
RFC 4408             Sender Policy Framework (SPF)            April 2006\
\
\
   "redirect" modifier.  If this number is exceeded during a check, a\
   PermError MUST be returned.  The "include", "a", "mx", "ptr", and\
   "exists" mechanisms as well as the "redirect" modifier do count\
   against this limit.  The "all", "ip4", and "ip6" mechanisms do not\
   require DNS lookups and therefore do not count against this limit.\
   The "exp" modifier does not count against this limit because the DNS\
   lookup to fetch the explanation string occurs after the SPF record\
   has been evaluated.\
\
   When evaluating the "mx" and "ptr" mechanisms, or the %{p} macro,\
   there MUST be a limit of no more than 10 MX or PTR RRs looked up and\
   checked.\
\
   SPF implementations SHOULD limit the total amount of data obtained\
   from the DNS queries.  For example, when DNS over TCP or EDNS0 are\
   available, there may need to be an explicit limit to how much data\
   will be accepted to prevent excessive bandwidth usage or memory usage\
   and DoS attacks.\
\
   MTAs or other processors MAY also impose a limit on the maximum\
   amount of elapsed time to evaluate check_host().  Such a limit SHOULD\
   allow at least 20 seconds.  If such a limit is exceeded, the result\
   of authorization SHOULD be "TempError".\
\
   Domains publishing records SHOULD try to keep the number of "include"\
   mechanisms and chained "redirect" modifiers to a minimum.  Domains\
   SHOULD also try to minimize the amount of other DNS information\
   needed to evaluate a record.  This can be done by choosing directives\
   that require less DNS information and placing lower-cost mechanisms\
   earlier in the SPF record.\
\
   For example, consider a domain set up as follows:\
\
   example.com.      IN MX   10 mx.example.com.\
   mx.example.com.   IN A    192.0.2.1\
   a.example.com.    IN TXT  "v=spf1 mx:example.com -all"\
   b.example.com.    IN TXT  "v=spf1 a:mx.example.com -all"\
   c.example.com.    IN TXT  "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.1 -all"\
\
   Evaluating check_host() for the domain "a.example.com" requires the\
   MX records for "example.com", and then the A records for the listed\
   hosts.  Evaluating for "b.example.com" requires only the A records.\
   Evaluating for "c.example.com" requires none.\
\
   However, there may be administrative considerations: using "a" over\
   "ip4" allows hosts to be renumbered easily.  Using "mx" over "a"\
   allows the set of mail hosts to be changed easily.\

\
\
10.2.  SPF-Authorized E-Mail May Contain Other False Identities\
\
   The "MAIL FROM" and "HELO" identity authorizations must not be\
   construed to provide more assurance than they do.  It is entirely\
   possible for a malicious sender to inject a message using his own\
   domain in the identities used by SPF, to have that domain's SPF\
   record authorize the sending host, and yet the message can easily\
   list other identities in its header.  Unless the user or the MUA\
   takes care to note that the authorized identity does not match the\
   other more commonly-presented identities (such as the From:  header\
   field), the user may be lulled into a false sense of security.\
\
10.3.  Spoofed DNS and IP Data\
\
   There are two aspects of this protocol that malicious parties could\
   exploit to undermine the validity of the check_host() function:\
\
   o  The evaluation of check_host() relies heavily on DNS.  A malicious\
      attacker could attack the DNS infrastructure and cause\
      check_host() to see spoofed DNS data, and then return incorrect\
      results.  This could include returning "Pass" for an <ip> value\
      where the actual domain's record would evaluate to "Fail".  See\
      [RFC3833] for a description of DNS weaknesses.\
\
   o  The client IP address, <ip>, is assumed to be correct.  A\
      malicious attacker could spoof TCP sequence numbers to make mail\
      appear to come from a permitted host for a domain that the\
      attacker is impersonating.\
\
10.4.  Cross-User Forgery\
\
   By definition, SPF policies just map domain names to sets of\
   authorized MTAs, not whole E-Mail addresses to sets of authorized\
   users.  Although the "l" macro (Section 8) provides a limited way to\
   define individual sets of authorized MTAs for specific E-Mail\
   addresses, it is generally impossible to verify, through SPF, the use\
   of specific E-Mail addresses by individual users of the same MTA.\
\
   It is up to mail services and their MTAs to directly prevent\
   cross-user forgery: based on SMTP AUTH ([RFC2554]), users should be\
   restricted to using only those E-Mail addresses that are actually\
   under their control (see [RFC4409], Section 6.1).  Another means to\
   verify the identity of individual users is message cryptography such\
   as PGP ([RFC2440]) or S/MIME ([RFC3851]).\

\
\
10.5.  Untrusted Information Sources\
\
   SPF uses information supplied by third parties, such as the "HELO"\
   domain name, the "MAIL FROM" address, and SPF records.  This\
   information is then passed to the receiver in the Received-SPF: trace\
   fields and possibly returned to the client MTA in the form of an SMTP\
   rejection message.  This information must be checked for invalid\
   characters and excessively long lines.\
\
   When the authorization check fails, an explanation string may be\
   included in the reject response.  Both the sender and the rejecting\
   receiver need to be aware that the explanation was determined by the\
   publisher of the SPF record checked and, in general, not the\
   receiver.  The explanation may contain malicious URLs, or it may be\
   offensive or misleading.\
\
   This is probably less of a concern than it may initially seem since\
   such messages are returned to the sender, and the explanation strings\
   come from the sender policy published by the domain in the identity\
   claimed by that very sender.  As long as the DSN is not redirected to\
   someone other than the actual sender, the only people who see\
   malicious explanation strings are people whose messages claim to be\
   from domains that publish such strings in their SPF records.  In\
   practice, DSNs can be misdirected, such as when an MTA accepts an\
   E-Mail and then later generates a DSN to a forged address, or when an\
   E-Mail forwarder does not direct the DSN back to the original sender.\
\
10.6.  Privacy Exposure\
\
   Checking SPF records causes DNS queries to be sent to the domain\
   owner.  These DNS queries, especially if they are caused by the\
   "exists" mechanism, can contain information about who is sending\
   E-Mail and likely to which MTA the E-Mail is being sent.  This can\
   introduce some privacy concerns, which may be more or less of an\
   issue depending on local laws and the relationship between the domain\
   owner and the person sending the E-Mail.\

11.  Contributors and Acknowledgements\
\
   This document is largely based on the work of Meng Weng Wong and Mark\
   Lentczner.  Although, as this section acknowledges, many people have\
   contributed to this document, a very large portion of the writing and\
   editing are due to Meng and Mark.\
\
   This design owes a debt of parentage to [RMX] by Hadmut Danisch and\
   to [DMP] by Gordon Fecyk.  The idea of using a DNS record to check\
   the legitimacy of an E-Mail address traces its ancestry further back\
   through messages on the namedroppers mailing list by Paul Vixie\

   [Green].\
\
   Philip Gladstone contributed the concept of macros to the\
   specification, multiplying the expressiveness of the language and\
   making per-user and per-IP lookups possible.\
\
   The authors would also like to thank the literally hundreds of\
   individuals who have participated in the development of this design.\
   They are far too numerous to name, but they include the following:\
\
      The folks on the spf-discuss mailing list.\
      The folks on the SPAM-L mailing list.\
      The folks on the IRTF ASRG mailing list.\
      The folks on the IETF MARID mailing list.\
      The folks on #perl.\
\
12.  IANA Considerations\
\
12.1.  The SPF DNS Record Type\
\
   The IANA has assigned a new Resource Record Type and Qtype from the\
   DNS Parameters Registry for the SPF RR type with code 99.\
\
12.2.  The Received-SPF Mail Header Field\
\
   Per [RFC3864], the "Received-SPF:" header field is added to the IANA\
   Permanent Message Header Field Registry.  The following is the\
   registration template:\
\
      Header field name: Received-SPF\
      Applicable protocol: mail ([RFC2822])\
      Status: Experimental\
      Author/Change controller: IETF\
      Specification document(s): RFC 4408\
      Related information:\
      Requesting SPF Council review of any proposed changes and\
      additions to this field are recommended.  For information about\
      the SPF Council see http://www.openspf.org/Council\

Appendix B.  Extended Examples\
\
   These examples are based on the following DNS setup:\
\
   ; A domain with two mail servers, two hosts\
   ; and two servers at the domain name\
   $ORIGIN example.com.\
   @           MX  10 mail-a\
               MX  20 mail-b\
               A   192.0.2.10\
               A   192.0.2.11\
   amy         A   192.0.2.65\
   bob         A   192.0.2.66\
   mail-a      A   192.0.2.129\
   mail-b      A   192.0.2.130\
   www         CNAME example.com.\
\
   ; A related domain\
   $ORIGIN example.org.\
   @           MX  10 mail-c\
   mail-c      A   192.0.2.140\
\
   ; The reverse IP for those addresses\
   $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.\
   10          PTR example.com.\
   11          PTR example.com.\
   65          PTR amy.example.com.\
   66          PTR bob.example.com.\
   129         PTR mail-a.example.com.\
   130         PTR mail-b.example.com.\
   140         PTR mail-c.example.org.\
\
   ; A rogue reverse IP domain that claims to be\
   ; something it's not\
   $ORIGIN 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.\
   4           PTR bob.example.com.\
\
B.1.  Simple Examples\
\
   These examples show various possible published records for\
   example.com and which values if <ip> would cause check_host() to\
   return "Pass".  Note that <domain> is "example.com".\
\
   v=spf1 +all\
      -- any <ip> passes\
\
   v=spf1 a -all\
      -- hosts 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 pass\

      -- sending host 192.0.2.65 fails\
      -- sending host 192.0.2.129 passes\
\
B.2.  Multiple Domain Example\
\
   These examples show the effect of related records:\
\
      example.org: "v=spf1 include:example.com include:example.net -all"\
\
   This record would be used if mail from example.org actually came\
   through servers at example.com and example.net.  Example.org's\
   designated servers are the union of example.com's and example.net's\
   designated servers.\
\
      la.example.org: "v=spf1 redirect=example.org"\
      ny.example.org: "v=spf1 redirect=example.org"\
      sf.example.org: "v=spf1 redirect=example.org"\
\
   These records allow a set of domains that all use the same mail\
   system to make use of that mail system's record.  In this way, only\
   the mail system's record needs to be updated when the mail setup\
   changes.  These domains' records never have to change.\

\
\
B.3.  DNSBL Style Example\
\
   Imagine that, in addition to the domain records listed above, there\
   are these:\
\
   $ORIGIN _spf.example.com.  mary.mobile-users                   A\
   127.0.0.2 fred.mobile-users                   A 127.0.0.2\
   15.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2\
   16.15.168.192.joel.remote-users     A 127.0.0.2\
\
   The following records describe users at example.com who mail from\
   arbitrary servers, or who mail from personal servers.\
\
   example.com:\
\
   v=spf1 mx\
          include:mobile-users._spf.%{d}\
          include:remote-users._spf.%{d}\
          -all\
\
   mobile-users._spf.example.com:\
\
   v=spf1 exists:%{l1r+}.%{d}\
\
   remote-users._spf.example.com:\
\
   v=spf1 exists:%{ir}.%{l1r+}.%{d}\
\
B.4.  Multiple Requirements Example\
\
   Say that your sender policy requires both that the IP address is\
   within a certain range and that the reverse DNS for the IP matches.\
   This can be done several ways, including the following:\
\
   example.com.           SPF  ( "v=spf1 "\
                                 "-include:ip4._spf.%{d} "\
                                 "-include:ptr._spf.%{d} "\
                                 "+all" )\
   ip4._spf.example.com.  SPF  "v=spf1 -ip4:192.0.2.0/24 +all"\
   ptr._spf.example.com.  SPF  "v=spf1 -ptr +all"\
\
   This example shows how the "-include" mechanism can be useful, how an\
   SPF record that ends in "+all" can be very restrictive, and the use\
   of De Morgan's Law.\

Abstract\
\
   This memo describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header\
   compression.  Header compression is possible because most header\
   fields do not vary randomly from packet to packet.  Many of the\
   fields exhibit static behavior or change in a more or less\
   predictable way.  When a header compression scheme is designed, it is\
   of fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the fields in\
   detail.  An example of this analysis can be seen in RFC 3095.  This\
   memo performs a similar role for the compression of TCP/IP headers.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document describes the format of the TCP/IP header and the\
   header field behavior, i.e., how fields vary within a TCP flow.  The\
   description is presented in the context of header compression.\
\
   Since the IP header does exhibit slightly different behavior from\
   that previously presented in RFC 3095 [31] for UDP and RTP, it is\
   also included in this document.\
\
   This document borrows much of the classification text from RFC 3095\
   [31], rather than inserting many references to that document.\
\
   According to the format presented in RFC 3095 [31], TCP/IP header\
   fields are classified and analyzed in two steps.  First, we have a\
   general classification in Section 2, where the fields are classified\
   on the basis of stable knowledge and assumptions.  This general\
   classification does not take into account the change characteristics\
   of changing fields, as those will vary more or less depending on the\
   implementation and on the application used.  Section 3 considers how\
   field values can be used to optimize short-lived flows.  A more\
   detailed analysis of the change characteristics is then done in\
   Section 4.  Finally, Section 5 summarizes with conclusions about how\
   the various header fields should be handled by the header compression\
   scheme to optimize compression.\
\
   A general question raised by this analysis is: what 'baseline'\
   definition of all possible TCP/IP implementations is to be\
   considered?  This review is based on an analysis of currently\
   deployed TCP implementations supporting mechanisms standardised by\
   the IETF.\
\
   The general requirement for transparency is also interesting.  A\
   number of recent proposals for extensions to TCP use some of the\
   previously 'reserved' bits in the TCP packet header.  Therefore, a\
   'reserved' bit cannot be taken to have a guaranteed zero value; it\
   may change.  Ideally, this should be accommodated by the compression\
   profile.\
\
   A number of reserved bits are available for future expansion.  A\
   treatment of field behavior cannot predict the future use of such\
   bits, but we expect that they will be used at some point.  Given\
   this, a compression scheme can optimise for the current situation but\
   should be capable of supporting any arbitrary usage of the reserved\
   bits.  However, it is impossible to optimise for usage patterns that\
   have yet to be defined.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
2.  General classification\
\
   The following definitions (and some text) are copied from RFC 3095\
   [31], Appendix A.  Differences of IP field behavior between RFC 3095\
   [31] (i.e., IP/UDP/RTP behavior for audio and video applications) and\
   this document have been identified.\
\
   For the following, we define "session" as a TCP packet stream, being\
   a series of packets with the same IP addresses and port numbers.  A\
   packet flow is defined by certain fields (see STATIC-DEF, below) and\
   may be considered a subset of a session.  See [31] for a fuller\
   discussion of separation of sessions into streams of packets for\
   header compression.\
\
   At a general level, the header fields are separated into 5 classes:\
\
   o  INFERRED\
\
         These fields contain values that can be inferred from other\
         values (for example, the size of the frame carrying the packet)\
         and thus do not have to be handled at all by the compression\
         scheme.\
\
   o  STATIC\
\
         These fields are expected to be constant throughout the\
         lifetime of the packet stream.  Static information must in some\
         way be communicated once.\
\
   o  STATIC-DEF\
\
         STATIC fields whose values define a packet stream.  They are in\
         general handled as STATIC.\
\
   o  STATIC-KNOWN\
\
         These STATIC fields are expected to have well-known values and\
         therefore do not need to be communicated at all.\
\
   o  CHANGING\
\
         These fields are expected to vary randomly within a limited\
         value set or range or in some other manner.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   In this section, each of the IP and TCP header fields is assigned to\
   one of these classes.  For all fields except those classified as\
   CHANGING, the motives for the classification are also stated.  In\
   section 4, CHANGING fields are further examined and classified on the\
   basis of their expected change behavior.\

                 and CE flags were amalgamated into the Traffic\
                 Class octet in RFC 3095).\
\
                          Figure 1.  IPv6 Header Fields\
\
   o  Version\
\
         The version field states which IP version is used.  Packets\
         with different values in this field must be handled by\
         different IP stacks.  All packets of a packet stream must\
         therefore be of the same IP version.  Accordingly, the field is\
         classified as STATIC.\
\
   o  Flow Label\
\
         This field may be used to identify packets belonging to a\
         specific packet stream.  If the field is not used, its value\
         should be zero.  Otherwise, all packets belonging to the same\
         stream must have the same value in this field, it being one of\
         the fields that define the stream.  The field is therefore\
         classified as STATIC-DEF.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   o  Payload Length\
\
         Information about packet length (and, consequently, payload\
         length) is expected to be provided by the link layer.  The\
         field is therefore classified as INFERRED.\
\
   o  Next Header\
\
         This field will usually have the same value in all packets of a\
         packet stream.  It encodes the type of the subsequent header.\
         Only when extension headers are sometimes absent will the field\
         change its value during the lifetime of the stream.  The field\
         is therefore classified as STATIC.  The classification of\
         STATIC is inherited from RFC 3095 [31].  However, note that the\
         next header field is actually determined by the type of the\
         following header.  Thus, it might be more appropriate to view\
         this as an inference, although this depends upon the specific\
         implementation of the compression scheme.\
\
   o  Source and Destination Addresses\
\
         These fields are part of the definition of a stream and\
         therefore must be constant for all packets in the stream.  The\
         fields are therefore classified as STATIC-DEF.\
\
         This might be considered as a slightly simplistic view.  In\
         this document, the IP addresses are associated with the\
         transport layer connection and assumed to be part of the\
         definition of a flow.  More complex flow-separation could, of\
         course, be considered (see also RFC 3095 [31] for more\
         discussion of this issue).  Where tunneling is being performed,\
         the use of the IP addresses in outer tunnel headers is also\
         assumed to be STATIC-DEF.\
\
   The total size of the fields in each class is as follows:\
\
                      +--------------+--------------+\
                      | Class        | Size (octets)|\

                      | INFERRED     |      2       |\
                      | STATIC       |      1.5     |\
                      | STATIC-DEF   |     34.5     |\
                      | STATIC-KNOWN |      0       |\
                      | CHANGING     |      2       |\

         different IP stacks.  All packets of a packet stream must\
         therefore be of the same IP version.  Accordingly, the field is\
         classified as STATIC.\
\
   o  Header Length\
\
         As long as no options are present in the IP header, the header\
         length is constant and well known.  If there are options, the\
         fields would be STATIC, but it is assumed here that there are\
         no options.  The field is therefore classified as STATIC-KNOWN.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   o  Packet Length\
\
         Information about packet length is expected to be provided by\
         the link layer.  The field is therefore classified as INFERRED.\
\
   o  Flags\
\
         The Reserved flag must be set to zero, as defined in RFC 791\
         [1].  In RFC 3095 [31] the field is therefore classified as\
         STATIC-KNOWN.  However, it is expected that reserved fields may\
         be used at some future point.  It is undesirable to select an\
         encoding that would preclude the use of a compression profile\
         for a future change in the use of reserved fields.  For this\
         reason, the alternative encoding of CHANGING is used.  (A\
         compression profile can, of course, still optimise for the\
         current situation, where the field value is known to be 0).\
\
         The More Fragments (MF) flag is expected to be zero because\
         fragmentation is, ideally, not expected.  However, it is also\
         understood that some scenarios (for example, some tunnelling\
         architectures) do cause fragmentation.  In general, though,\
         fragmentation is not expected to be common in the Internet due\
         to a combination of initial MSS negotiation and subsequent use\
         of path-MTU discovery.  RFC 3095 [31] points out that, for RTP,\
         only the first fragment will contain the transport layer\
         protocol header; subsequent fragments would have to be\
         compressed with a different profile.  This is also obviously\
         the case for TCP.  If fragmentation were to occur, the first\
         fragment, by definition, would be relatively large, minimizing\
         the header overhead.  Subsequent fragments would be compressed\
         with another profile.  It is therefore considered undesirable\
         to optimise for fragmentation in performing header compression.\
         The More Fragments flag is therefore classified as STATIC-\
         KNOWN.\
\
   o  Fragment Offset\
\
         Under the assumption that no fragmentation occurs, the fragment\
         offset is always zero.  The field is therefore classified as\
         STATIC-KNOWN.  Even if fragmentation were to be further\
         considered, only the first fragment would contain the TCP\
         header, and the fragment offset of this packet would still be\
         zero.\
\
   o  Protocol\
\
         This field will usually have the same value in all packets of a\
         packet stream.  It encodes the type of the subsequent header.\

\
\
         Only where the sequence of headers changes (e.g., an extension\
         header is inserted or deleted or a tunnel header is added or\
         removed) will the field change its value.  The field is\
         therefore classified as STATIC.  Whether such a change would\
         cause the sequence of packets to be treated as a new flow (for\
         header compression) is an issue for profile design.  ROHC\
         profiles must be able to cope with extension headers and\
         tunnelling, but the choice of strategy is outside the scope of\
         this document.\
\
   o  Header Checksum\
\
         The header checksum protects individual hops from processing a\
         corrupted header.  When almost all IP header information is\
         compressed away, there is no point in having this additional\
         checksum.  Instead, it can be regenerated at the decompressor\
         side.  The field is therefore classified as INFERRED.\
\
         Note that the TCP checksum does not protect the whole TCP/IP\
         header, but only the TCP pseudo-header (and the payload).\
         Compare this with ROHC [31], which uses a CRC to verify the\
         uncompressed header.  Given the need to validate the complete\
         TCP/IP header, the cost of computing the TCP checksum over the\
         entire payload, and known weaknesses in the TCP checksum [37],\
         an additional check is necessary.  Therefore, it is highly\
         desirable that some additional checksum (such as a CRC) will be\
         used to validate correct decompression.\
\
   o  Source and Destination Addresses\
\
         These fields are part of the definition of a stream and must\
         thus be constant for all packets in the stream.  The fields are\
         therefore classified as STATIC-DEF.\
\
   The total size of the fields in each class is as follows:\
\
                      +--------------+--------------+\
                      | Class        | Size (octets)|\

\
3.  Classification of Replicable Header Fields\
\
   Where multiple flows either overlap in time or occur sequentially\
   within a short space of time, there can be a great deal of similarity\
   in header field values.  Such commonality of field values is\
   reflected in the compression context.  Thus, it should be possible to\
   utilise commonality between fields across different flows to improve\
   the compression ratio.  In order to do this, it is important to\
   understand the 'replicable' characteristics of the various header\
   fields.\
\
   The key concept is that of 'replication': an existing context is used\
   as a baseline and replicated to initialise a new context.  Those\
   fields that are the same are then automatically initialised in the\
   new context.  Those that have changed will be updated or overwritten\
   with values from the initialisation packet that triggered the\
   replication.  This section considers the commonality between fields\
   in different flows.\
\
   Note, however, that replication is based on contexts (rather than on\
   just field values), so compressor-created fields that are part of the\
   context may also be included.  These, of course, are dependent upon\
   the nature of the compression protocol (ROHC profile) being applied.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   A brief analysis of the relationship of TCP/IP fields among\
   'replicable' packet streams follows.\
\
      'N/A': The field need not be considered in the replication\
            process, as it is inferred or known 'a priori' (and,\
            therefore, does not appear in the context).\
\
      'No': The field cannot be replicated since its change pattern\
            between two packet flows is uncorrelated.\
\
      'Yes': The field may be replicated.  This does not guarantee that\
            the field value will be the same across two candidate\
            streams, only that it might be possible to exploit\
            replication to increase the compression ratio.  Specific\
            encoding methods can be used to improve the compression\
            efficiency.\

\
   (1) The DSCP is marked according to the application's requirements.\
       If it can be assumed that replicable connections belong to the\
       same diffserv class, then it is likely that the DSCP will be\
       replicable.  The DSCP can be set not only by the sender but by\
       any packet marker.  Thus, a flow may have a number of DSCP values\
       at different points in the network.  However, header compression\
\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
       operates on a point-to-point link and so would expect to see a\
       relatively stable value.  If re-marking is being done based on\
       the state of a meter, then the value may change mid-flow.\
       Overall, though, we expect supporting replication of the DSCP to\
       be useful for header compression.\
\
   (2) It is not possible for the ECN bits to be replicated (note that\
       use of the ECN nonce scheme [19] is anticipated).  However, it\
       seems likely that all TCP flows between ECN-capable hosts will\
       use ECN, the use (or not) of ECN for flows between the same end-\
       points might be considered replicable.  See also note (4).\
\
   (3) The replicable context for this field includes the IP-ID, NBO,\
       and RND flags (as described in ROHC RTP).  This highlights that\
       the replication is of the context, rather than just the header\
       field values and, as such, needs to be considered based on the\
       exact nature of compression applied to each field.\
\
   (4) Since the possible future behavior of the 'Reserved Flag' cannot\
       be predicted, it is not considered as replicable.  However, it\
       might be expected that the behavior of the reserved flag between\
       the same end-points will be similar.  In this case, any selection\
       of packet formats (for example) based on this behavior might\
       carry across to the new flow.  In the case of packet formats,\
       this can probably be considered as a compressor-local decision.\
\
   (5) In theory, the DF bit may be replicable.  However, this is not\
       guaranteed and, in practice, it is unlikely to be useful to do\
       this.  From the perspective of header compression, having to\
       indicate whether or not a 1-bit flag should be replicated or\
       specified explicitly is likely to require more bits than simply\
       conveying the value of the flag.  We do not rule out DF\
       replication.\

\
   (1) On the server side, the port number is likely to be a well-known\
       value.  On the client side, the port number is generally selected\
       by the stack automatically.  Whether the port number is\
       replicable depends upon how the stack chooses the port number.\
       Whilst most implementations use a simple scheme that sequentially\
       picks the next available port number, it may not be desirable to\
       rely on this behavior.\
\
   (2) With the recommendation (and expected deployment) of TCP Initial\
       Sequence Number randomization, defined in RFC 1948 [10], it will\
       be impossible to share the sequence number.  Thus, this field\
       will not be regarded as replicable.\

\
   (1) This indicates whether the option only appears in SYN packets.\
       Options that are not 'SYN-only' may appear in any packet.  Many\
       TCP options are used only in SYN packets.  Some options, such as\
       MSS, Window Scale, and SACK-Permitted, will tend to have the same\
       value among replicable packet streams.\
\
       Thus, to support context sharing, the compressor should maintain\
       such TCP options in the context (even though they only appear in\
       the SYN segment).\
\
   (2) Since these options have fixed values, they could be regarded as\
       replicable.  However, the only interesting thing to convey about\

\
\
       these options is their presence.  If it is known that such an\
       option exists, its value is defined.\
\
3.5.  Summary of Replication\
\
   From the above analysis, it can be seen that there are reasonable\
   grounds for exploiting redundancy between flows as well as between\
   packets within a flow.  Simply consider the advantage of being able\
   to elide the source and destination addresses for a repeated\
   connection between two IPv6 endpoints.  There will also be a cost (in\
   terms of complexity and robustness) for replicating contexts, and\
   this must be considered when one decides what constitutes an\
   appropriate solution.\
\
   Finally, note that the use of replication requires that the\
   compressor have a suitable degree of confidence that the source data\
   is present and correct at the decompressor.  This may place some\
   restrictions on which of the 'changing' fields, in particular, can be\
   utilised during replication.\
\
4.  Analysis of Change Patterns of Header Fields\
\
   To design suitable mechanisms for efficient compression of all header\
   fields, their change patterns must be analyzed.  For this reason, an\
   extended classification is done based on the general classification\
   in 2, considering the fields that were labeled CHANGING in that\
   classification.\
\
   The CHANGING fields are separated into five different subclasses:\
\
   o  STATIC\
\
      These are fields that were classified as CHANGING on a general\
      basis, but that are classified as STATIC here due to certain\
      additional assumptions.\
\
   o  SEMISTATIC\
\
      These fields are STATIC most of the time.  However, occasionally\
      the value changes but reverts to its original value after a known\
      number of packets.\
\
   o  RARELY-CHANGING (RC)\
\
      These are fields that change their values occasionally and then\
      keep their new values.\
\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   o  ALTERNATING\
\
      These fields alternate between a small number of different values.\
\
   o  IRREGULAR\
\
      These, finally, are the fields for which no useful change pattern\
      can be identified.\
\
   To further expand the classification possibilities without increasing\
   complexity, the classification can be done either according to the\
   values of the field and/or according to the values of the deltas for\
   the field.\
\
   When the classification is done, other details are also stated\
   regarding possible additional knowledge about the field values and/or\
   field deltas, according to the classification.  For fields classified\
   as STATIC or SEMISTATIC, the value of the field could be not only\
   STATIC but also well-KNOWN a priori (two states for SEMISTATIC\
   fields).  For fields with non-irregular change behavior, it could be\
   known that changes are usually within a LIMITED range compared to the\
   maximal change for the field.  For other fields, the values are\
   completely UNKNOWN.\
\
   Figure 11 classifies all the CHANGING fields on the basis of their\
   expected change patterns. (4) refers to IPv4 fields and (6) refers to\
   IPv6.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   The following subsections discuss the various header fields in\
   detail.  Note that Table 1 and the discussion below do not consider\
   changes caused by loss or reordering before the compression point.\
\
4.1.  IP Header\
\
4.1.1.  IP Traffic-Class / Type-Of-Service (TOS)\
\
   The Traffic-Class (IPv6) or Type-Of-Service/DSCP (IPv4) field might\
   be expected to change during the lifetime of a packet stream.  This\
   analysis considers several RFCs that describe modifications to the\
   original RFC 791 [1].\
\
   The TOS byte was initially described in RFC 791 [1] as 3 bits of\
   precedence followed by 3 bits of TOS and 2 reserved bits (defined to\
   be zero).  RFC 1122 [21] extended this to specify 5 bits of TOS,\
   although the meanings of the additional 2 bits were not defined.  RFC\
   1349 [23] defined the 4th bit of TOS as 'minimize monetary cost'.\
   The next significant change was in RFC 2474 [14] (obsoleting RFC 1349\
   [23]).  RFC 2474 reworked the TOS octet as 6 bits of DSCP (DiffServ\
   Code Point) plus 2 unused bits.  Most recently, RFC 2780 [30]\
   identified the 2 reserved bits in the TOS or traffic class octet for\
   experimental use with ECN.\
\
   It is therefore proposed that the TOS (or traffic class) octet be\
   classified as 6 bits for the DSCP and 2 additional bits.  These 2\
   bits may be expected to be zero or to contain ECN data.  From a\
   future-proofing perspective, it is preferable to assume the use of\
   ECN, especially with respect to TCP.\
\
   It is also considered important that the profile work with legacy\
   stacks, since these will be in existence for some considerable time\
   to come.  For simplicity, this will be considered as 6 bits of TOS\
   information and 2 bits of ECN data, so the fields are always\
   considered to be structured the same way.\
\
   The DSCP (as for TOS in ROHC RTP) is not expected to change\
   frequently (although it could change mid-flow, for example, as a\
   result of a route change).\
\
4.1.2.  ECN Flags\
\
   Initially, we describe the ECN flags as specified in RFC 2481 [15]\
   and RFC 3168 [18].  Subsequently, a suggested update is described\
   that would alter the behavior of the flags.\
\
   In RFC 2481 [15] there are 2 separate flags, the ECT (ECN Capable\
   Transport) flag and the CE (Congestion Experienced) flag.  The ECT\
\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   flag, if negotiated by the TCP stack, will be '1' for all data\
   packets and '0' for all 'pure acknowledgement' packets.  This means\
   that the behavior of the ECT flag is linked to behavior in the TCP\
   stack.  Whether this can be exploited for compression is not clear.\
\
   The CE flag is only used if ECT is set to '1'.  It is set to '0' by\
   the sender and can be set to '1' by an ECN-capable router in the\
   network to indicate congestion.  Thus the CE flag is expected to be\
   randomly set to '1' with a probability dependent on the congestion\
   state of the network and the position of the compressor in the path.\
   Therefore, a compressor located close to the receiver in a congested\
   network will see the CE bit set frequently, but a compressor located\
   close to a sender will rarely, if ever, see the CE bit set to '1'.\
\
   A recent experimental proposal [19] suggests an alternative view of\
   these 2 bits.  This considers the two bits together to have 4\
   possible codepoints.  Meanings are then assigned to the codepoints:\
\
      00 Not ECN capable\
      01 ECN capable, no congestion (known as ECT(0))\
      10 ECN capable, no congestion (known as ECT(1))\
      11 Congestion experienced\
\
   The use of 2 codepoints for signaling ECT allows the sender to detect\
   when a receiver is not reliably echoing congestion information.\
\
   For the purposes of compression, this update means that ECT(0) and\
   ECT(1) are equally likely (for an ECN capable flow) and that '11'\
   will be seen relatively rarely.  The probability of seeing a\
   congestion indication is discussed above in the description of the CE\
   flag.\
\
   It is suggested that, for the purposes of compression, ECN with\
   nonces be assumed as the baseline, although the compression scheme\
   must be able to compress the original ECN scheme transparently.\
\
4.1.3.  IP Identification\
\
   The Identification field (IP ID) of the IPv4 header identifies which\
   fragments constitute a datagram, when fragmented datagrams are\
   reassembled.  The IPv4 specification does not specify exactly how\
   this field is to be assigned values, only that each packet should get\
   an IP ID that is unique for the source-destination pair and protocol\
   for the time during which the datagram (or any of its fragments)\
   could be alive in the network.  This means that assignment of IP ID\
   values can be done in various ways, which we have separated into\
   three classes:\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   o  Sequential jump\
\
      This is the most common assignment policy in today's IP stacks.  A\
      single IP ID counter is used for all packet streams.  When the\
      sender is running more than one packet stream simultaneously, the\
      IP ID can increase by more than one between packets in a stream.\
      The IP ID values will be much more predictable and will require\
      fewer bits to transfer than random values, and the packet-to-\
      packet increment (determined by the number of active outgoing\
      packet streams and sending frequencies) will usually be limited.\
\
   o  Random\
\
      Some IP stacks assign IP ID values by using a pseudo-random number\
      generator.  There is thus no correlation between the ID values of\
      subsequent datagrams.  Therefore, there is no way to predict the\
      IP ID value for the next datagram.  For header compression\
      purposes, this means that the IP ID field needs to be sent\
      uncompressed with each datagram, resulting in two extra octets of\
      header.  IP stacks in cellular terminals that need optimum header\
      compression efficiency should not use this IP ID assignment\
      policy.\
\
   o  Sequential\
\
      This assignment policy keeps a separate counter for each outgoing\
      packet stream, and thus the IP ID value will increment by one for\
      each packet in the stream, except at wrap around.  Therefore, the\
      delta value of the field is constant and well known a priori.\
      This assignment policy is the most desirable for header\
      compression purposes.  However, its usage is not as common as it\
      perhaps should be.\
\
      In order to avoid violating RFC 791 [1], packets sharing the same\
      IP address pair and IP protocol number cannot use the same IP ID\
      values.  Therefore, implementations of sequential policies must\
      make the ID number spaces disjoint for packet streams of the same\
      IP protocol going between the same pair of nodes.  This can be\
      done in a number of ways, all of which introduce occasional jumps\
      and thus make the policy less than perfectly sequential.  For\
      header compression purposes, less frequent jumps are preferred.\
\
   Note that the ID is an IPv4 mechanism and is therefore not a problem\
   for IPv6.  For IPv4, the ID could be handled in three different ways.\
   First, we have the inefficient but reliable solution where the ID\
   field is sent as-is in all packets, increasing the compressed headers\
   by two octets.  This is the best way to handle the ID field if the\
   sender uses random assignment of the ID field.  Second, there can be\
\
\

\
RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   solutions with more flexible mechanisms that require fewer bits for\
   the ID handling as long as sequential jump assignment is used.  Such\
   solutions will probably require even more bits if random assignment\
   is used by the sender.  Knowledge about the sender's assignment\
   policy could therefore be useful when choosing between the two\
   solutions above.  Finally, even for IPv4, header compression could be\
   designed without any additional information for the ID field included\
   in compressed headers.  To use such schemes, it must be known which\
   assignment policy for the ID field is being used by the sender.  That\
   might not be possible to know, which implies that the applicability\
   of such solutions is very uncertain.  However, designers of IPv4\
   stacks for cellular terminals should use an assignment policy close\
   to sequential.\
\
   With regard to TCP compression, the behavior of the IP ID field is\
   essentially the same.  However, in RFC 3095 [31], the IP ID is\
   generally inferred from the RTP Sequence Number.  There is no obvious\
   candidate in the TCP case for a field to offer this 'master sequence\
   number' role.\
\
   Clearly, from a busy server, the observed behavior may well be quite\
   erratic.  This is a case where the ability to share the IP\
   compression context between a number of flows (between the same end-\
   points) could offer potential benefits.  However, this would only\
   have any real impact where there is a large number of flows between\
   one machine and the server.  If context sharing is being considered,\
   then it is preferable to share the IP part of the context.\
\
4.1.4.  Don't Fragment (DF) flag\
\
   Path-MTU discovery (RFC 1191 for IPv4 [6] and RFC 1981 for IPv6 [11])\
   is widely deployed for TCP, in contrast to little current use for UDP\
   packet streams.  This employs the DF flag value of '1' to detect the\
   need for fragmentation in the end-to-end path and to probe the\
   minimum MTU along the network path.  End hosts using this technique\
   may be expected to send all packets with DF set to '1', although a\
   host may end PMTU discovery by clearing the DF bit to '0'.  Thus, for\
   compression, we expect the field value to be stable.\
\
4.1.5.  IP Hop-Limit / Time-To-Live (TTL)\
\
   The Hop-Limit (IPv6) or Time-To-Live (IPv4) field is expected to be\
   constant during the lifetime of a packet stream or to alternate\
   between a limited number of values due to route changes.\

\
\
4.2.  TCP Header\
\
   Any discussion of compressability of TCP fields borrows heavily from\
   RFC 1144 [22].  However, the premise of how the compression is\
   performed is slightly different, and the protocol has evolved\
   slightly in the intervening time.\
\
4.2.1.  Sequence Number\
\
   Understanding the sequence and acknowledgement number behavior is\
   essential for a TCP compression scheme.\
\
   At the simplest level, the behavior of the sequence number can be\
   described relatively easily.  However, there are a number of\
   complicating factors that also need to be considered.\
\
   For transferring in-sequence data packets, the sequence number will\
   increment for each packet by between 0 and an upper limit defined by\
   the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) and, if it is being used, by Path-MTU\
   discovery.\
\
   There are common MSS values, but these can be quite variable and\
   unpredictable for any given flow.  Given this variability and the\
   range of window sizes, it is hard (compared with the RTP case, for\
   example) to select a 'one size fits all' encoding for the sequence\
   number.  (The same argument applies equally to the acknowledgement\
   number).\
\
   Note that the increment of the sequence number in a packet is the\
   size of the data payload of that packet (including the SYN and FIN\
   flags).  This is, of course, exactly the relationship that RFC 1144\
   [22] exploits to compress the sequence number in the most efficient\
   case.  This technique may not be directly applicable to a robust\
   solution, but it may be a useful relationship to consider.\
\
   However, at any point on the path (i.e., wherever a compressor might\
   be deployed), the sequence number can be anywhere within a range\
   defined by the TCP window.  This is a combination of a number of\
   values (buffer space at the sender; advertised buffer size at the\
   receiver; and TCP congestion control algorithms).  Missing packets or\
   retransmissions can cause the TCP sequence number to fluctuate within\
   the limits of this window.\
\
   It is desirable to be able to predict the sequence number with some\
   regularity.  However, this also appears to be difficult to do.  For\
   example, during bulk data transfer, the sequence number will tend to\
   go up by 1 MSS per packet (assuming no packet loss).  Higher layer\
   values have been seen to have an impact as well, where sequence\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   number behavior has been observed with an 8 kbyte repeating pattern\
   -- 5 segments of 1460 bytes followed by 1 segment of 892 bytes.  The\
   implementation of TCP and the management of buffers within a protocol\
   stack can affect the behavior of the sequence number.\
\
   It may be possible to track the TCP window by the compressor,\
   allowing it to bound the size of these jumps.\
\
   For interactive flows (for example, telnet), the sequence number will\
   change by small, irregular amounts.  In this case, the Nagle\
   algorithm [3] commonly applies, coalescing small packets where\
   possible in order to reduce the basic header overhead.  This may also\
   mean that predictable changes in the sequence number are less likely\
   to occur.  The Nagle algorithm is an optimisation and is not required\
   to be used (applications can disable its use).  However, it is turned\
   on by default in all common TCP implementations.\
\
   Note also that the SYN and FIN flags (which have to be acknowledged)\
   each consume 1 byte of sequence space.\
\
4.2.2.  Acknowledgement Number\
\
   Much of the information about the sequence number applies equally to\
   the acknowledgement number.  However, there are some important\
   differences.\
\
   For bulk data transfers, there will tend to be 1 acknowledgement for\
   every 2 data segments.  The algorithm is specified in RFC 2581 [16].\
   An ACK need not always be sent immediately on receipt of a data\
   segment, but it must be sent within 500ms and should be generated for\
   at least every second full-size segment (MSS) of received data.  It\
   may be seen from this that the delta for the acknowledgement number\
   is roughly twice that of the sequence number.  This is not always the\
   case, and the discussion about sequence number irregularity should be\
   applied.\
\
   As an aside, a common implementation bug is 'stretch ACKs' [33]\
   (acknowledgements may be generated less frequently than every two\
   full-size data segments).  This pattern can also occur following loss\
   on the return path.\
\
   Since the acknowledgement number is cumulative, dropped packets in\
   the forward path will result in the acknowledgement number remaining\
   constant for a time in the reverse direction.  Retransmission of a\
   dropped segment can then cause a substantial jump in the\
   acknowledgement number.  These jumps in acknowledgement number are\
   bounded by the TCP window, just as for the jumps in sequence number.\

\
\
   In the acknowledgement case, information about the advertised\
   received window gives a bound to the size of any ACK jump.\
\
4.2.3.  Reserved\
\
   This field is reserved, and it therefore might be expected to be\
   zero.  This can no longer be assumed, due to future-proofing.  It is\
   only a matter of time before a suggestion for using the flag is made.\
\
4.2.4.  Flags\
\
   o  ECN-E (Explicit Congestion Notification)\
\
      '1' to echo CE bit in IP header.  It will be set in several\
      consecutive headers (until 'acknowledged' by CWR).  If ECN nonces\
      are used, then there will be a 'nonce-sum' (NS) bit in the flags,\
      as well.  Again, transparency of the reserved bits is crucial for\
      future-proofing this compression scheme.  From an\
      efficiency/compression standpoint, the NS bit will either be\
      unused (always '0') or randomly changing.  The nonce sum is the\
      1-bit sum of the ECT codepoints, as described in [19].\
\
   o  CWR (Congestion Window Reduced)\
\
      '1' to signal congestion window reduced on ECN.  It will generally\
      be set in individual packets.  The flag will be set once per loss\
      event.  Thus, the probability of its being set is proportional to\
      the degree of congestion in the network, but it is less likely to\
      be set than the CE flag.\
\
   o  ECE (Echo Congestion Experience)\
\
      If 'congestion experienced' is signaled in a received IP header,\
      this is echoed through the ECE bit in segments sent by the\
      receiver until acknowledged by seeing the CWR bit set.  Clearly,\
      in periods of high congestion and/or long RTT, this flag will\
      frequently be set to '1'.\
\
      During connection open (SYN and SYN/ACK packets), the ECN bits\
      have special meaning:\
\
      * CWR and ECN-E are both set with SYN to indicate desire to use\
        ECN.\

\
\
      * CWR only is set in SYN-ACK, to agree to ECN.\
\
        (The difference in bit-patterns for the negotiation is such that\
        it will work with broken stacks that reflect the value of\
        reserved bits).\
\
   o  URG (Urgent Flag)\
\
      '1' to indicate urgent data (which is unlikely with any flag other\
      than ACK).\
\
   o  ACK (Acknowledgement)\
\
      '1' for all except the initial 'SYN' packet.\
\
   o  PSH (Push Function Field)\
\
      Generally accepted to be randomly '0' or '1'.  However, it may be\
      biased more to one value than the other (this is largely caused by\
      the implementation of the stack).\
\
   o  RST (Reset Connection)\
\
      '1' to reset a connection (unlikely with any flag other than ACK).\
\
   o  SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number)\
\
      '1' for the SYN/SYN-ACK, only at the start of a connection.\
\
   o  FIN (End of Data: FINished)\
\
      '1' to indicate 'no more data' (unlikely with any flag other than\
      ACK).\
\
4.2.5.  Checksum\
\
   Carried as the end-to-end check for the TCP data.  See RFC 1144 [22]\
   for a discussion of why this should be carried.  A header compression\
   scheme should not rely upon the TCP checksum for robustness, though,\
   and should apply appropriate error-detection mechanisms of its own.\
   The TCP checksum has to be considered to be randomly changing.\
\
4.2.6.  Window\
\
   This may oscillate randomly between 0 and the receiver's window limit\
   (for the connection).\
\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   In practice, the window will either not change or alternate between a\
   relatively small number of values.  Particularly when the window is\
   closing (its value is getting smaller), the change in window is\
   likely to be related to the segment size, but it is not clear that\
   this necessarily offers any compression advantage.  When the window\
   is opening, the effect of 'Silly-Window Syndrome' avoidance should be\
   remembered.  This prevents the window from opening by small amounts\
   that would encourage the sender to clock out small segments.\
\
   When thinking about what fields might change in a sequence of TCP\
   segments, one should note that the receiver can generate 'window\
   update' segments in which only the window advertisement changes.\
\
4.2.7.  Urgent Pointer\
\
   From a compression point of view, the Urgent Pointer is interesting\
   because it offers an example where 'semantically identical'\
   compression is not the same as 'bitwise identical'.  This is because\
   the value of the Urgent Pointer is only valid if the URG flag is set.\
\
   However, the TCP checksum must be passed transparently, in order to\
   maintain its end-to-end integrity checking property.  Since the TCP\
   checksum includes the Urgent Pointer in its coverage, this enforces\
   bitwise transparency of the Urgent Pointer.  Thus, the issue of\
   'semantic' vs. 'bitwise' identity is presented as a note: the Urgent\
   Pointer must be compressed in a way that preserves its value.\
\
   If the URG flag is set, then the Urgent Pointer indicates the end of\
   the urgent data and thus can point anywhere in the window.  It may be\
   set (and changing) over several segments.  Note that urgent data is\
   rarely used, since it is not a particularly clean way of managing\
   out-of-band data.\
\
4.3.  Options\
\
   Options occupy space at the end of the TCP header.  All options are\
   included in the checksum.  An option may begin on any byte boundary.\
   The TCP header must be padded with zeros to make the header length a\
   multiple of 32 bits.\
\
   Optional header fields are identified by an option kind field.\
   Options 0 and 1 are exactly one octet, which is their kind field.\
   All other options have their one-octet kind field, followed by a\
   one-octet length field, followed by length-2 octets of option data.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
4.3.2.  Option Field Behavior\
\
   Generally speaking, all option fields have been classified as\
   changing.  This section describes the behavior of each option\
   referenced within an RFC, listed by 'kind' indicator.\
\
      0: End of Option List\
\
         This option code indicates the end of the option list.  This\
         might not coincide with the end of the TCP header according to\
         the Data Offset field.  This is used at the end of all options,\
         not at the end of each option, and it need only be used if the\
         end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of\
         the TCP header.  Defined in RFC 793 [2].\
\
         There is no data associated with this option, so a compression\
         scheme must simply be able to encode its presence.  However,\
         note that since this option marks the end of the list and the\
         TCP options are 4-octet aligned, there may be octets of padding\
         (defined to be '0' in [2]) after this option.\
\
      1: No-Operation\
\
         This option code may be used between options, for example, to\
         align the beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.\
         There is no guarantee that senders will use this option, so\
         receivers must be prepared to process options even if they do\
         not begin on a word boundary RFC 793 [2].  There is no data\
         associated with this option, so a compression scheme must\
         simply be able to encode its presence.  This may be done by\
         noting that the option simply maintains a certain alignment and\
         that compression need only convey this alignment.  In this way,\
         padding can just be removed.\
\
      2: Maximum Segment Size\
\
         If this option is present, then it communicates the maximum\
         segment size that may be used to send a packet to this end-\
         host.  This field must only be sent in the initial connection\
         request (i.e., in segments with the SYN control bit set).  If\
         this option is not used, any segment size is allowed RFC 793\
         [2].\
\
         This option is very common.  The segment size is a 16-bit\
         quantity.  Theoretically, this could take any value; however\
         there are a number of values that are common.  For example,\
         1460 bytes is very common for TCP/IPv4 over Ethernet (though\
         with the increased prevalence of tunnels, for example, smaller\
\

\
\
         values such as 1400 have become more popular). 536 bytes is the\
         default MSS value.  This may allow for common values to be\
         encoded more efficiently.\
\
      3: Window Scale Option (WSopt)\
\
         This option may be sent in a SYN segment by the TCP end-host\
         (1) to indicate that the sending TCP end-host is prepared to\
             perform both send and receive window scaling, and\
         (2) to communicate a scale factor to be applied to its receive\
             window.\
\
         The scale factor is encoded logarithmically as a power of 2\
         (presumably to be implemented by binary shifts).  Note that the\
         window in the SYN segment itself is never scaled (RFC 1072\
         [4]).  This option may be sent in an initial segment (i.e., in\
         a segment with the SYN bit on and the ACK bit off).  It may\
         also be sent in later segments, but only if a Window Scale\
         option was received in the initial segment.  A Window Scale\
         option in a segment without a SYN bit should be ignored.  The\
         Window field in a SYN segment itself is never scaled (RFC 1323\
         [7]).\
\
         The use of window scaling does not affect the encoding of any\
         other field during the lifetime of the flow.  Only the encoding\
         of the window scaling option itself is important.  The window\
         scale must be between 0 and 14 (inclusive).  Generally, smaller\
         values would be expected (a window scale of 14 allows for a\
         1Gbyte window, which is extremely large).\
\
      4: SACK-Permitted\
\
         This option may be sent in a SYN by a TCP that has been\
         extended to receive (and presumably to process) the SACK option\
         once the connection has opened RFC 2018 [12].  There is no data\
         in this option all that is required is for the presence of the\
         option to be encoded.\
\
      5: SACK\
\
         This option is to be used to convey extended acknowledgment\
         information over an established connection.  Specifically, it\
         is to be sent by a data receiver to inform the data transmitter\
         of non-contiguous blocks of data that have been received and\
         queued.  The data receiver awaits the receipt of data in later\
         retransmissions to fill the gaps in sequence space between\
         these blocks.  At that time, the data receiver acknowledges the\
         data, normally by advancing the left window edge in the\
\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
         Acknowledgment Number field of the TCP header.  It is important\
         to understand that the SACK option will not change the meaning\
         of the Acknowledgment Number field, whose value will still\
         specify the left window edge, i.e., one byte beyond the last\
         sequence number of fully received data (RFC 2018 [12]).\
\
         If SACK has been negotiated (through an exchange of SACK-\
         Permitted options), then this option may occur when dropped\
         segments are noticed by the receiver.  Because this identifies\
         ranges of blocks within the receiver's window, it can be viewed\
         as a base value with a number of offsets.  The base value (left\
         edge of the first block) can be viewed as offset from the TCP\
         acknowledgement number.  There can be up to 4 SACK blocks in a\
         single option.  SACK blocks may occur in a number of segments\
         (if there is more out-of-order data 'on the wire'), and this\
         will typically extend the size of or add to the existing\
         blocks.\
\
         Alternative proposals such as DSACK RFC 2883 [17] do not\
         fundamentally change the behavior of the SACK block, from the\
         point of view of the information contained within it.\
\
      6: Echo\
\
         This option carries information that the receiving TCP may send\
         back in a subsequent TCP Echo Reply option (see below).  A TCP\
         may send the TCP Echo option in any segment, but only if a TCP\
         Echo option was received in a SYN segment for the connection.\
         When the TCP echo option is used for RTT measurement, it will\
         be included in data segments, and the four information bytes\
         will define the time at which the data segment was transmitted\
         in any format convenient to the sender (see RFC 1072 [4]).\
\
         The Echo option is generally not used in practice -- it is\
         obsoleted by the Timestamp option.  However, for transparency\
         it is desirable that a compression scheme be able to transport\
         it.  (However, there is no benefit in attempting any treatment\
         more sophisticated than viewing it as a generic 'option').\
\
      7: Echo Reply\
\
         A TCP that receives a TCP Echo option containing four\
         information bytes will return these same bytes in a TCP Echo\
         Reply option.  This TCP Echo Reply option must be returned in\
         the next segment (e.g., an ACK segment) that is sent.  If more\
         than one Echo option is received before a reply segment is\
         sent, the TCP must choose only one of the options to echo,\

\
         ignoring the others; specifically, it must choose the newest\
         segment with the oldest sequence number (see RFC 1072 [4]).\
\
         The Echo Reply option is generally not used in practice -- it\
         is obsoleted by the Timestamp option.  However, for\
         transparency it is desirable that a compression scheme be able\
         to transport it.  (However, there is no benefit in attempting\
         any more sophisticated treatment than viewing it as a generic\
         'option').\
\
      8: Timestamps\
\
         This option carries two four-byte timestamp fields.  The\
         Timestamp Value field (TSval) contains the current value of the\
         timestamp clock of the TCP sending the option.  The Timestamp\
         Echo Reply field (TSecr) is only valid if the ACK bit is set in\
         the TCP header; if it is valid, it echoes a timestamp value\
         that was sent by the remote TCP in the TSval field of a\
         Timestamps option.  When TSecr is not valid, its value must be\
         zero.  The TSecr value will generally be from the most recent\
         Timestamp option that was received; however, there are\
         exceptions that are explained below.  A TCP may send the\
         Timestamps option (TSopt) in an initial segment (i.e., a\
         segment containing a SYN bit and no ACK bit), and it may send a\
         TSopt in other segments only if it received a TSopt in the\
         initial segment for the connection (see RFC 1323 [7]).\
         Timestamps are quite commonly used.  If timestamp options are\
         exchanged in the connection set-up phase, then they are\
         expected to appear on all subsequent segments.  If this\
         exchange does not happen, then they will not appear for the\
         remainder of the flow.\
\
         Because the value being carried is a timestamp, it is logical\
         to expect that the entire value need not be carried.  There is\
         no obvious pattern of increments that might be expected,\
         however.\
\
         An important reason for using the timestamp option is to allow\
         detection of sequence space wrap-around (Protection Against\
         Wrapped Sequence-number, or PAWS, see RFC 1323 [7]).  It is not\
         expected that this is a serious concern on the links on which\
         TCP header compression would be deployed, but it is important\
         that the integrity of this option be maintained.  This issue is\
         discussed in, for example, RFC 3150 [32].  However, the\
         proposed Eifel algorithm [35] makes use of timestamps, so it is\
         currently recommended that timestamps be used for cellular-type\
         links [34].\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
         With regard to compression, note that the range of resolutions\
         for the timestamp suggested in RFC 1323 [7] is quite wide (1ms\
         to 1s per 'tick').  This (along with the perhaps wide variation\
         in RTT) makes it hard to select a set of encodings that will be\
         optimal in all cases.\
\
      9: Partial Order Connection (POC) permitted\
\
         This option represents a simple indicator communicated between\
         the two peer transport entities to establish the operation of\
         the POC protocol.  See RFC 1693 [9].\
\
         The Partial Order Connection option sees little (or no) use in\
         the current Internet, so the only requirement is that the\
         header compression scheme be able to encode it.\
\
      10: POC service profile\
\
         This option serves to communicate the information necessary to\
         carry out the job of the protocol -- the type of information\
         that is typically found in the header of a TCP segment.  The\
         Partial Order Connection option sees little (or no) use in the\
         current Internet, so the only requirement is that the header\
         compression scheme be able to encode it.\
\
      11: Connection Count (CC)\
\
         This option is part of the implementation of TCP Accelerated\
         Open (TAO) that effectively bypasses the TCP Three-Way\
         Handshake (3WHS).  TAO introduces a 32-bit incarnation number,\
         called a "connection count" (CC), that is carried in a TCP\
         option in each segment.  A distinct CC value is assigned to\
         each direction of an open connection.  The implementation\
         assigns monotonically increasing CC values to successive\
         connections that it opens actively or passively (see RFC 1644\
         [8]).  This option sees little (or no) use in the current\
         Internet, so the only requirement is that the header\
         compression scheme be able to encode it.\
\
      12: CC.NEW\
\
         Correctness of the TAO mechanism requires that clients generate\
         monotonically increasing CC values for successive connection\
         initiations.  Receiving a CC.NEW causes the server to\
         invalidate its cache entry and to do a 3WHS.  See RFC 1644 [8].\
         This option sees little (or no) use in the current Internet, so\
         the only requirement is that the header compression scheme be\
         able to encode it.\

\
\
      13: CC.ECHO\
\
         When a server host sends a segment, it echoes the connection\
         count from the initial in a CC.ECHO option, which is used by\
         the client host to validate the segment (see RFC 1644 [8]).\
         This option sees little (or no) use in the current Internet, so\
         the only requirement is that the header compression scheme be\
         able to encode it.\
\
      14: Alternate Checksum Request\
\
         This option may be sent in a SYN segment by a TCP to indicate\
         that the TCP is prepared to both generate and receive checksums\
         based on an alternate algorithm.  During communication, the\
         alternate checksum replaces the regular TCP checksum in the\
         checksum field of the TCP header.  Should the alternate\
         checksum require more than 2 octets to transmit, either the\
         checksum may be moved into a TCP Alternate Checksum Data Option\
         and the checksum field of the TCP header be sent as zero, or\
         the data may be split between the header field and the option.\
         Alternate checksums are computed over the same data as the\
         regular TCP checksum; see RFC 1146 [5].\
\
         This option sees little (or no) use in the current Internet, so\
         the only requirement is that the header compression scheme be\
         able to encode it.  It would only occur in connection set-up\
         (SYN) packets.  Even if this option were used, it would not\
         affect the handling of the checksum, since this should be\
         carried transparently in any case.\
\
      15: Alternate Checksum Data\
\
         This field is used only when the alternate checksum that is\
         negotiated is longer than 16 bits.  These checksums will not\
         fit in the checksum field of the TCP header and thus at least\
         part of them must be put in an option.  Whether the checksum is\
         split between the checksum field in the TCP header and the\
         option or the entire checksum is placed in the option is\
         determined on a checksum-by-checksum basis.  The length of this\
         option will depend on the choice of alternate checksum\
         algorithm for this connection; see RFC 1146 [5].\
\
         If an alternative checksum was negotiated in the connection\
         set-up, then this option may appear on all subsequent packets\
         (if needed to carry the checksum data).  However, this option\
         is in practice never seen, so the only requirement is that the\
         header compression scheme be able to encode it.\

\
      19: MD5 Digest\
\
         Every segment sent on a TCP connection to be protected against\
         spoofing will contain the 16-byte MD5 digest produced by\
         applying the MD5 algorithm to a concatenated block of data\
         [13].\
\
         Upon receiving a signed segment, the receiver must validate it\
         by calculating its own digest from the same data (using its own\
         key) and comparing the two digests.  A failing comparison must\
         result in the segment's being dropped and must not produce any\
         response back to the sender.  Logging the failure is probably\
         advisable.\
\
         Unlike other TCP extensions (e.g., the Window Scale option\
         [7]), the absence of the option in the SYN-ACK segment must not\
         cause the sender to disable its sending of signatures.  This\
         negotiation is typically done to prevent some TCP\
         implementations from misbehaving upon receiving options in non-\
         SYN segments.  This is not a problem for this option, since the\
         SYN-ACK sent during connection negotiation will not be signed\
         and will thus be ignored.  The connection will never be made,\
         and non-SYN segments with options will never be sent.  More\
         importantly, the sending of signatures must be under the\
         complete control of the application, not at the mercy of a\
         remote host not understanding the option.  MD5 digest\
         information should, like any cryptographically secure data, be\
         incompressible.  Therefore the compression scheme must simply\
         transparently carry this option, if it occurs.\

\
         Thse non-RFC option types are not considered in this document.\
         This only means that their behavior is not described in detail,\
         as a compression scheme is not expected to be optimised for\
         these options.  However, any unrecognised option must be\
         carried by a TCP compression scheme transparently, in order to\
         work efficiently in the presence of new or rare options.\
\
   The above list covers options known at the time of writing.  Other\
   options are expected to be defined.  It is important that any future\
   options can be handled by a header compression scheme.  The\
   processing of as-yet undefined options cannot be optimised but, at\
   the very least, unknown options should be carried transparently.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   The current model for TCP options is that an option is negotiated in\
   the SYN exchange and used thereafter, if the negotiation succeeds.\
   This leads to some assumptions about the presence of options (being\
   only on packets with the SYN flag set, or appearing on every packet,\
   for example).  Where such assumptions hold true, it may be possible\
   to optimise compression of options slightly.  However, it is seen as\
   undesirable to be so constrained, as there is no guarantee that\
   option handling and negotiation will remain the same in the future.\
   Also note that a compressor may not process the SYN packets of a flow\
   and cannot, therefore, be assumed to know which options have been\
   negotiated.\
\
5.  Other Observations\
\
5.1.  Implicit Acknowledgements\
\
   There may be a small number of cues for 'implicit acknowledgements'\
   in a TCP flow.  Even if the compressor only sees the data transfer\
   direction, for example, seeing a packet without the SYN flag set\
   implies that the SYN packet has been received.\
\
   There is a clear requirement for the deployment of compression to be\
   topologically independent.  This means that it is not actually\
   possible to be sure that seeing a data packet at the compressor\
   guarantees that the SYN packet has been correctly received by the\
   decompressor (as the SYN packet may have taken an alternative path).\
\
   However, there may be other such cues, which may be used in certain\
   circumstances to improve compression efficiency.\
\
5.2.  Shared Data\
\
   It can be seen that there are two distinct deployments (i) where the\
   forward (data) and reverse (ACK) path are both carried over a common\
   link, and (ii) where the forward (data) and reverse (ACK) path are\
   carried over different paths, with a specific link carrying packets\
   corresponding to only one direction of communication.\
\
   In the former case, a compressor and decompressor could be colocated.\
   It may then be possible for the compressor and decompressor at each\
   end of the link to exchange information.  This could lead to possible\
   optimizations.\
\
   For example, acknowledgement numbers are generally taken from the\
   sequence numbers in the opposite direction.  Since an acknowledgement\
   cannot be generated for a packet that has not passed across the link,\
   this offers an efficient way of encoding acknowledgements.\

RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
5.3.  TCP Header Overhead\
\
   For a TCP bulk data-transfer, the overhead of the TCP header does not\
   form a large proportion of the data packet (e.g., < 3% for a 1460\
   octet packet), particularly compared to the typical RTP voice case.\
   Spectral efficiency is clearly an important goal.  However,\
   extracting every last bit of compression gain offers only marginal\
   benefit at a considerable cost in complexity.  This trade-off, of\
   efficiency and complexity, must be addressed in the design of a TCP\
   compression profile.\
\
   However, in the acknowledgement direction (i.e., for 'pure'\
   acknowledgement headers), the overhead could be said to be infinite\
   (since there is no data being carried).  This is why optimizations\
   for the acknowledgement path may be considered useful.\
\
   There are a number of schemes for manipulating TCP acknowledgements\
   to reduce the ACK bandwidth.  Many of these are documented in [33]\
   and [32].  Most of these schemes are entirely compatible with header\
   compression, without requiring any particular support.  While it is\
   not expected that a compression scheme will be optimised for\
   experimental options, it is useful to consider these when developing\
   header compression schemes, and vice versa.  A header compression\
   scheme must be able to support any option (including ones as yet\
   undefined).\
\
5.4.  Field Independence and Packet Behavior\
\
   It should be apparent that direct comparisons with the highly\
   'packet'-based view of RTP compression are hard.  RTP header fields\
   tend to change regularly per-packet, and many fields (IPv4 IP ID, RTP\
   sequence number, and RTP timestamp, for example) typically change in\
   a dependent manner.  However, TCP fields, such as sequence number\
   tend to change more unpredictably, partly because of the influence of\
   external factors (size of TCP windows, application behavior, etc.).\
   Also, the field values tend to change independently.  Overall, this\
   makes compression more challenging and makes it harder to select a\
   set of encodings that can successfully trade off efficiency and\
   robustness.\
\
5.5.  Short-Lived Flows\
\
   It is hard to see what can be done to improve performance for a\
   single, unpredictable, short-lived connection.  However, there are\
   commonly cases where there will be multiple TCP connections between\
   the same pair of hosts.  As a particular example, consider web\
   browsing (this is more the case with HTTP/1.0 [25] than with HTTP/1.1\
   [26]).\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4413                 TCP/IP Field Behavior                March 2006\
\
\
   When a connection closes, either it is the last connection between\
   that pair of hosts or it is likely that another connection will open\
   within a relatively short space of time.  In this case, the IP header\
   part of the context (i.e., those fields characterised in Section 2.1)\
   will probably be almost identical.  Certain aspects of the TCP\
   context may also be similar.\
\
   Support for context replication is discussed in more detail in\
   Section 3.  Overall, support for sub-context sharing or initializing\
   one context from another offers useful optimizations for a sequence\
   of short-lived connections.\
\
   Note that, although TCP is connection oriented, it is hard for a\
   compressor to tell whether a TCP flow has finished.  For example,\
   even in the 'bi-directional' link case, seeing a FIN and the ACK of\
   the FIN at the compressor/decompressor does not mean that the FIN\
   cannot be retransmitted.  Thus, it may be more useful to think about\
   initializing a new context from an existing one, rather than re-using\
   an existing one.\
\
   As mentioned previously in Section 4.1.3, the IP header can clearly\
   be shared between any transport-layer flows between the same two\
   end-points.  There may be limited scope for initialisation of a new\
   TCP header from an existing one.  The port numbers are the most\
   obvious starting point.\
\
5.6.  Master Sequence Number\
\
   As pointed out earlier, in Section 4.1.3, there is no obvious\
   candidate for a 'master sequence number' in TCP.  Moreover, it is\
   noted that such a master sequence number is only required to allow a\
   decompressor to acknowledge packets in bi-directional mode.  It can\
   also be seen that such a sequence number would not be required for\
   every packet.\
\
   While the sequence number only needs to be 'sparse', it is clear that\
   there is a requirement for an explicitly added sequence number.\
   There are no obvious ways to guarantee the unique identity of a\
   packet other than by adding such a sequence number (sequence and\
   acknowledgement numbers can both remain the same, for example).\
\
5.7.  Size Constraint for TCP Options\
\
   As can be seen from the above analysis, most TCP options, such as\
   MSS, WSopt, or SACK-Permitted, may appear only on a SYN segment.\
   Every implementation should (and we expect that most will) ignore\
   unknown options on SYN segments.  TCP options will be sent on non-SYN\
   segments only when an exchange of options on the SYN segments has\

\
\
   indicated that both sides understand the extension.  Other TCP\
   options, such as MD5 Digest or Timestamp, also tend to be sent when\
   the connection is initiated (i.e., in the SYN packet).\
\
   The total header size is also an issue.  The TCP header specifies\
   where segment data starts with a 4-bit field that gives the total\
   size of the header (including options) in 32-bit words.  This means\
   that the total size of the header plus option must be less than or\
   equal to 60 bytes.  This leaves 40 bytes for options.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   Since this document only describes TCP field behavior, it raises no\
   direct security concerns.\
\
   This memo is intended to be used to aid the compression of TCP/IP\
   headers.  Where authentication mechanisms such as IPsec AH [24] are\
   used, it is important that compression be transparent.  Where\
   encryption methods such as IPsec ESP [27] are used, the TCP fields\
   may not be visible, preventing compression.\
\
7.  Acknowledgements\
\
   Many IP and TCP RFCs (hopefully all of which have been collated\
   below), together with header compression schemes from RFC 1144 [22],\
   RFC 3544 [36], and RFC 3095 [31], and of course the detailed analysis\
   of RTP/UDP/IP in RFC 3095, have been sources of ideas and knowledge.\
   Further background information can also be found in [28] and [29].\
\
   This document also benefited from discussion on the ROHC mailing list\
   and in various corridors (virtual or otherwise) about many key\
   issues; special thanks go to Qian Zhang, Carsten Bormann, and Gorry\
   Fairhurst.\

   shareable header fields.\

Abstract\
\
   This document defines two new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
   header fields for communicating resource priority, namely,\
   "Resource-Priority" and "Accept-Resource-Priority".  The\
   "Resource-Priority" header field can influence the behavior of SIP\
   user agents (such as telephone gateways and IP telephones) and SIP\
   proxies.  It does not directly influence the forwarding behavior of\
   IP routers.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   During emergencies, communications resources (including telephone\
   circuits, IP bandwidth, and gateways between the circuit-switched and\
   IP networks) may become congested.  Congestion can occur due to heavy\
   usage, loss of resources caused by the natural or man-made disaster,\
   and attacks on the network during man-made emergencies.  This\
   congestion may make it difficult for persons charged with emergency\
   assistance, recovery, or law enforcement to coordinate their efforts.\
   As IP networks become part of converged or hybrid networks, along\
   with public and private circuit-switched (telephone) networks, it\
   becomes necessary to ensure that these networks can assist during\
   such emergencies.\
\
   Also, users may want to interrupt their lower-priority communications\
   activities and dedicate their end-system resources to the high-\
   priority communications attempt if a high-priority communications\
   request arrives at their end system.\
\
   There are many IP-based services that can assist during emergencies.\
   This memo only covers real-time communications applications involving\
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], including voice-\
   over-IP, multimedia conferencing, instant messaging, and presence.\
\
   SIP applications may involve at least five different resources that\
   may become scarce and congested during emergencies.  These resources\
   include gateway resources, circuit-switched network resources, IP\
   network resources, receiving end-system resources, and SIP proxy\
   resources.  IP network resources are beyond the scope of SIP\
   signaling and are therefore not considered here.\
\
   Even if the resources at the SIP element itself are not scarce, a SIP\
   gateway may mark outgoing calls with an indication of priority, e.g.,\
   on an ISUP (ISDN User Part) IAM (Initial Address Message) originated\
   by a SIP gateway with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\
\
   In order to improve emergency response, it may become necessary to\
   prioritize access to SIP-signaled resources during periods of\
   emergency-induced resource scarcity.  We call this "resource\
   prioritization".  The mechanism itself may well be in place at all\
   times, but may only materially affect call handling during times of\
   resource scarcity.\
\
   Currently, SIP does not include a mechanism that allows a request\
   originator to indicate to a SIP element that it wishes the request to\
   invoke such resource prioritization.  To address this need, this\
   document adds a SIP protocol element that labels certain SIP\
   requests.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   This document defines (Section 3) two new SIP header fields for\
   communications resource priority, called 'Resource-Priority' and\
   'Accept-Resource-Priority'.  The 'Resource-Priority' header field MAY\
   be used by SIP user agents, including Public Switched Telephone\
   Network (PSTN) gateways and terminals, and SIP proxy servers to\
   influence their treatment of SIP requests, including the priority\
   afforded to PSTN calls.  For PSTN gateways, the behavior translates\
   into analogous schemes in the PSTN, for example, the ITU\
   Recommendation Q.735.3 [Q.735.3] prioritization mechanism, in both\
   the PSTN-to-IP and IP-to-PSTN directions.  ITU Recommendation I.255.3\
   [I.255.3] is another example.\
\
   A SIP request with a 'Resource-Priority' indication can be treated\
   differently in these situations:\
\
   1.  The request can be given elevated priority for access to PSTN\
       gateway resources, such as trunk circuits.\
\
   2.  The request can interrupt lower-priority requests at a user\
       terminal, such as an IP phone.\
\
   3.  The request can carry information from one multi-level priority\
       domain in the telephone network (e.g., using the facilities of\
       Q.735.3 [Q.735.3]) to another, without the SIP proxies themselves\
       inspecting or modifying the header field.\
\
   4.  In SIP proxies and back-to-back user agents, requests of higher\
       priorities may displace existing signaling requests or bypass\
       PSTN gateway capacity limits in effect for lower priorities.\
\
   This header field is related to, but differs in semantics from, the\
   'Priority' header field ([RFC3261], Section 20.26).  The 'Priority'\
   header field describes the importance that the SIP request should\
   have for the receiving human or its agent.  For example, that header\
   may be factored into decisions about call routing to mobile devices\
   and assistants and about call acceptance when the call destination is\
   busy.  The 'Priority' header field does not affect the usage of PSTN\
   gateway or proxy resources, for example.  In addition, any User Agent\
   Client (UAC) can assert any 'Priority' value, and usage of 'Resource-\
   Priority' header field values is subject to authorization.\
\
   While the 'Resource-Priority' header field does not directly\
   influence the forwarding behavior of IP routers or the use of\
   communications resources such as packet forwarding priority,\
   procedures for using this header field to cause such influence may be\
   defined in other documents.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   Existing implementations of RFC 3261 that do not participate in the\
   resource priority mechanism follow the normal rules of RFC 3261,\
   Section 8.2.2: "If a UAS does not understand a header field in a\
   request (that is, the header field is not defined in this\
   specification or in any supported extension), the server MUST ignore\
   that header field and continue processing the message".  Thus, the\
   use of this mechanism is wholly invisible to existing implementations\
   unless the request includes the Require header field with the\
   resource-priority option tag.\
\
   The mechanism described here can be used for emergency preparedness\
   in emergency telecommunications systems, but is only a small part of\
   an emergency preparedness network and is not restricted to such use.\
\
   The mechanism aims to satisfy the requirements in [RFC3487].  It is\
   structured so that it works in all SIP and Real-Time Transport\
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] transparent networks, defined in [RFC3487].\
   In such networks, all network elements and SIP proxies let valid SIP\
   requests pass through unchanged.  This is important since it is\
   likely that this mechanism will often be deployed in networks where\
   the edge networks are unaware of the resource priority mechanism and\
   provide no special privileges to such requests.  The request then\
   reaches a PSTN gateway or set of SIP elements that are aware of the\
   mechanism.\
\
   For conciseness, we refer to SIP proxies and user agents (UAs) that\
   act on the 'Resource-Priority' header field as RP actors.\
\
   It is likely to be common that the same SIP element will handle\
   requests that bear the 'Resource-Priority' header fields and those\
   that do not.\
\
   Government entities and standardization bodies have developed several\
   different priority schemes for their networks.  Users would like to\
   be able to obtain authorized priority handling in several of these\
   networks, without changing SIP clients.  Also, a single call may\
   traverse SIP elements that are run by different administrations and\
   subject to different priority mechanisms.  Since there is no global\
   ordering among those priorities, we allow each request to contain\
   more than one priority value drawn from these different priority\
   lists, called a namespace in this document.  Typically, each SIP\
   element only supports one such namespace, but we discuss what happens\
   if an element needs to support multiple namespaces in Section 8.\
\
   Since gaining prioritized access to resources offers opportunities to\
   deny service to others, it is expected that all such prioritized\
   calls are subject to authentication and authorization, using standard\
   SIP security (Section 11) or other appropriate mechanisms.\

\
\
   The remainder of this document is structured as follows.  After\
   defining terminology in Section 2, we define the syntax for the two\
   new SIP header fields in Section 3 and then describe protocol\
   behavior in Section 4.  The two principal mechanisms for\
   differentiated treatment of SIP requests (namely, preemption and\
   queueing) are described in Section 4.5.  Error conditions are covered\
   in Section 4.6.  Sections 4.7.1 through 4.7.3 detail the behavior of\
   specific SIP elements.  Third-party authentication is briefly\
   summarized in Section 5.  Section 6 describes how this feature\
   affects existing systems that do not support it.\
\
   Since calls may traverse multiple administrative domains with\
   different namespaces or multiple elements with the same namespace, it\
   is strongly suggested that all such domains and elements apply the\
   same algorithms for the same namespace, as otherwise the end-to-end\
   experience of privileged users may be compromised.\
\
   Protocol examples are given in Section 7.  Section 8 discusses what\
   happens if a request contains multiple namespaces or an element can\
   handle more than one namespace.  Section 9 enumerates the information\
   that namespace registrations need to provide.  Section 10 defines the\
   properties of five namespaces that are registered through this\
   document.  Security issues are considered in Section 11, but this\
   document does not define new security mechanisms.  Section 12\
   discusses IANA considerations and registers parameters related to\
   this document.\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",\
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",\
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\
   [RFC2119], and indicate requirement levels for compliant\
   implementations.\
\
3.  The Resource-Priority and Accept-Resource-Priority SIP Header Fields\
\
   This section defines the 'Resource-Priority' and\
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' SIP header field syntax.  Behavior is\
   described in Section 4.\
\
3.1.  The 'Resource-Priority' Header Field\
\
   The 'Resource-Priority' request header field marks a SIP request as\
   desiring prioritized access to resources, as described in the\
   introduction.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   There is no protocol requirement that all requests within a SIP\
   dialog or session use the 'Resource-Priority' header field.  Local\
   administrative policy MAY mandate the inclusion of the\
   'Resource-Priority' header field in all requests.  Implementations of\
   this specification MUST allow inclusion to be either by explicit user\
   request or automatic for all requests.\
\
   The syntax of the 'Resource-Priority' header field is described\
   below.  The "token-nodot" production is copied from [RFC3265].\
\
      Resource-Priority  = "Resource-Priority" HCOLON\
                           r-value *(COMMA r-value)\
      r-value            = namespace "." r-priority\
      namespace          = token-nodot\
      r-priority         = token-nodot\
      token-nodot        = 1*( alphanum / "-"  / "!" / "%" / "*"\
                                  / "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" )\
\
   An example 'Resource-Priority' header field is shown below:\
\
      Resource-Priority: dsn.flash\
\
   The 'r-value' parameter in the 'Resource-Priority' header field\
   indicates the resource priority desired by the request originator.\
   Each resource value (r-value) is formatted as 'namespace' '.'\
   'priority value'.  The value is drawn from the namespace identified\
   by the 'namespace' token.  Namespaces and priorities are case-\
   insensitive ASCII tokens that do not contain periods.  Thus,\
   "dsn.flash" and "DSN.Flash", for example, are equivalent.  Each\
   namespace has at least one priority value.  Namespaces and priority\
   values within each namespace MUST be registered with IANA\
   (Section 12).  Initial namespace registrations are described in\
   Section 12.5.\
\
   Since a request may traverse multiple administrative domains with\
   multiple different namespaces, it is necessary to be able to\
   enumerate several different namespaces within the same message.\
   However, a particular namespace MUST NOT appear more than once in the\
   same SIP message.  These may be expressed equivalently as either\
   comma-separated lists within a single header field, as multiple\
   header fields, or as some combination.  The ordering of 'r-values'\
   within the header field has no significance.  Thus, for example, the\
   following three header snippets are equivalent:\
\
     Resource-Priority: dsn.flash, wps.3\
\
     Resource-Priority: wps.3, dsn.flash\

     Resource-Priority: dsn.flash\
\
3.2.  The 'Accept-Resource-Priority' Header Field\
\
   The 'Accept-Resource-Priority' response header field enumerates the\
   resource values (r-values) a SIP user agent server is willing to\
   process.  (This does not imply that a call with such values will find\
   sufficient resources and succeed.)  The syntax of the 'Accept-\
   Resource-Priority' header field is as follows:\
\
      Accept-Resource-Priority = "Accept-Resource-Priority" HCOLON\
                                 [r-value *(COMMA r-value)]\
\
   An example is given below:\
\
   Accept-Resource-Priority: dsn.flash-override,\
        dsn.flash, dsn.immediate, dsn.priority, dsn.routine\
\
   Some administrative domains MAY choose to disable the use of the\
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' header for revealing too much information\
   about that domain in responses.  However, this behavior is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED, as this header field aids in troubleshooting.\
\
3.3.  Usage of the 'Resource-Priority' and 'Accept-Resource-Priority'\
      Header Fields\

   The following table extends the values in Table 2 of RFC 3261\

\
\
   Other request methods MAY define their own handling rules; unless\
   otherwise specified, recipients MAY ignore these header fields.\
\
3.4.  The 'resource-priority' Option Tag\
\
   This document also defines the "resource-priority" option tag.  The\
   behavior is described in Section 4.3, and the IANA registration is in\
   Section 12.3.\
\
4.  Behavior of SIP Elements That Receive Prioritized Requests\
\
4.1.  Introduction\
\
   All SIP user agents and proxy servers that support this specification\
   share certain common behavior, which we describe below in\
   Section 4.2.  The behavior when a 'resource-priority' option tag is\
   encountered in a 'Require' header field is described in Section 4.3.\
   Section 4.4 describes the treatment of OPTIONS requests.  The two\
   fundamental resource contention resolution mechanisms, preemption and\
   queueing, are described in Section 4.5.  Section 4.6 explains what\
   happens when requests fail.  Behavior specific to user agent clients,\
   servers, and proxy servers is covered in Section 4.7.\
\
4.2.  General Rules\
\
   The 'Resource-Priority' header field is potentially applicable to all\
   SIP request messages.  At a minimum, implementations of the following\
   request types MUST support the Resource-Priority header to be in\
   compliance with this specification:\
\
   o  INVITE [RFC3261]\
\
   o  ACK [RFC3261]\
\
   o  PRACK [RFC3262]\
\
   o  UPDATE [RFC3311]\
\
   o  REFER [RFC3515]\
\
   Implementations SHOULD support the 'Resource-Priority' header field\
   in the following request types:\
\
   o  MESSAGE [RFC3428]\
\
   o  SUBSCRIBE [RFC3265]\
\
   o  NOTIFY [RFC3265]\
\

\
RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   Note that this does not imply that all implementations have to\
   support all request methods listed.\
\
   If a SIP element receives the 'Resource-Priority' header field in a\
   request other than those listed above, the header MAY be ignored,\
   according to the rules of [RFC3261].\
\
   In short, an RP actor performs the following steps when receiving a\
   prioritized request.  Error behavior is described in Section 4.6.\
\
   1.  If the RP actor recognizes none of the name spaces, it treats the\
       request as if it had no 'Resource-Priority' header field.\
\
   2.  It ascertains that the request is authorized according to local\
       policy to use the priority levels indicated.  If the request is\
       not authorized, it rejects it.  Examples of authorization\
       policies are discussed in Security Considerations (Section 11).\
\
   3.  If the request is authorized and resources are available (no\
       congestion), it serves the request as usual.  If the request is\
       authorized but resources are not available (congestion), it\
       either preempts other current sessions or inserts the request\
       into a priority queue, as described in Section 4.5.\
\
4.3.  Usage of Require Header with Resource-Priority\
\
   Following standard SIP behavior, if a SIP request contains the\
   'Require' header field with the 'resource-priority' option tag, a SIP\
   user agent MUST respond with a 420 (Bad Extension) if it does not\
   support the SIP extensions described in this document.  It then lists\
   "resource-priority" in the 'Unsupported' header field included in the\
   response.\
\
   The use of the 'resource-priority' option tag in 'Proxy-Require'\
   header field is NOT RECOMMENDED.\
\
4.4.  OPTIONS Request with Resource-Priority\
\
   An OPTIONS request can be used to determine if an element supports\
   the mechanism.  A compliant implementation SHOULD return an 'Accept-\
   Resource-Priority' header field in OPTIONS responses enumerating all\
   valid resource values, but an RP actor MAY be configured not to\
   return such values or only to return them to authorized requestors.\
\
   Following standard SIP behavior, OPTIONS responses MUST include the\
   'Supported' header field that includes the 'resource-priority' option\
   tag.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   According to RFC 3261, Section 11, proxies that receive a request\
   with a 'Max-Forwards' header field value of zero MAY answer the\
   OPTIONS request, allowing a UAC to discover the capabilities of both\
   proxy and user agent servers.\
\
4.5.  Approaches for Preferential Treatment of Requests\
\
   SIP elements may use the resource priority mechanism to modify a\
   variety of behaviors, such as routing requests, authentication\
   requirements, override of network capacity controls, or logging.  The\
   resource priority mechanism may influence the treatment of the\
   request itself, the marking of outbound PSTN calls at a gateway, or\
   of the session created by the request.  (Here, we use the terms\
   session and call interchangeably, both implying a continuous data\
   stream between two or more parties.  Sessions are established by SIP\
   dialogs.)\
\
   Below, we define two common algorithms, namely, preemption and\
   priority queueing.  Preemption applies only to sessions created by\
   SIP requests, while both sessions and request handling can be subject\
   to priority queueing.  Both algorithms can sometimes be combined in\
   the same element, although none of the namespaces described in this\
   document do this.  Algorithms can be defined for each namespace or,\
   in some cases, can be specific to an administrative domain.  Other\
   behavior, such as request routing or network management controls, is\
   not defined by this specification.\
\
   Naturally, only SIP elements that understand this mechanism and the\
   namespace and resource value perform these algorithms.  Section 4.6.2\
   discusses what happens if an RP actor does not understand priority\
   values contained in a request.\
\
4.5.1.  Preemption\
\
   An RP actor following a preemption policy may disrupt an existing\
   session to make room for a higher-priority incoming session.  Since\
   sessions may require different amounts of bandwidth or a different\
   number of circuits, a single higher-priority session may displace\
   more than one lower-priority session.  Unless otherwise noted,\
   requests do not preempt other requests of equal priority.  As noted\
   above, the processing of SIP requests itself is not preempted.  Thus,\
   since proxies do not manage sessions, they do not perform preemption.\
\
   [RFC4411] contains more details and examples of this behavior.\
\
   UAS behavior for preemption is discussed in Section 4.7.2.1.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
4.5.2.  Priority Queueing\
\
   In a priority queueing policy, requests that find no available\
   resources are queued to the queue assigned to the priority value.\
   Unless otherwise specified, requests are queued in first-come, first-\
   served order.  Each priority value may have its own queue, or several\
   priority values may share a single queue.  If a resource becomes\
   available, the RP actor selects the request from the highest-priority\
   non-empty queue according to the queue service policy.  For first-\
   come, first-served policies, the request from that queue that has\
   been waiting the longest is served.  Each queue can hold a finite\
   number of pending requests.  If the per-priority-value queue for a\
   newly arriving request is full, the request is rejected immediately,\
   with the status codes specified in Section 4.6.5 and Section 4.6.6.\
   In addition, a priority queueing policy MAY impose a waiting time\
   limit for each priority class, whereby requests that exceed a\
   specified waiting time are ejected from the queue and a 408 (Request\
   Timeout) failure response is returned to the requestor.\
\
   Finally, an RP actor MAY impose a global queue size limit summed\
   across all queues and drop waiting lower-priority requests with a 408\
   (Request Timeout) failure response.  This does not imply preemption,\
   since the session has not been established yet.\
\
   UAS behavior for queueing is discussed in Section 4.7.2.2.\
\
4.6.  Error Conditions\
\
4.6.1.  Introduction\
\
   In this section, we describe the error behavior that is shared among\
   multiple types of RP actors (including various instances of UAS such\
   as trunk gateways, line gateways, and IP phones) and proxies.\
\
   A request containing a resource priority indication can fail for four\
   reasons:\
\
   o  the RP actor does not understand the priority value\
      (Section 4.6.2),\
\
   o  the requestor is not authenticated (Section 4.6.3),\
\
   o  an authenticated requestor is not authorized to make such a\
      request (Section 4.6.4), or\
\
   o  there are insufficient resources for an authorized request\
      (Section 4.6.5).\
\

\
RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   We treat these error cases in the order that they typically arise in\
   the processing of requests with Resource-Priority headers.  However,\
   this order is not mandated.  For example, an RP actor that knows that\
   a particular resource value cannot be served or queued MAY, as a\
   matter of local policy, forgo authorization, since it would only add\
   processing load without changing the outcome.\
\
4.6.2.  No Known Namespace or Priority Value\
\
   If an RP actor does not understand any of the resource values in the\
   request, the treatment depends on the presence of the 'Require'\
   'resource-priority' option tag:\
\
   1.  Without the option tag, the RP actor treats the request as if it\
       contained no 'Resource-Priority' header field and processes it\
       with default priority.  Resource values that are not understood\
       MUST NOT be modified or deleted.\
\
   2.  With the option tag, it MUST reject the request with a 417\
       (Unknown Resource-Priority) response code.\
\
   Making case (1) the default is necessary since otherwise there would\
   be no way to successfully complete any calls in the case where a\
   proxy on the way to the UAS shares no common namespaces with the UAC,\
   but the UAC and UAS do have such a namespace in common.\
\
   In general, as noted, a SIP request can contain more than one\
   'Resource-Priority' header field.  This is necessary if a request\
   needs to traverse different administrative domains, each with its own\
   set of valid resource values.  For example, the ETS namespace might\
   be enabled for United States government networks that also support\
   the DSN and/or DRSN namespaces for most individuals in those domains.\
\
   A 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority) response MAY, according to local\
   policy, include an 'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field\
   enumerating the acceptable resource values.\
\
4.6.3.  Authentication Failure\
\
   If the request is not authenticated, a 401 (Unauthorized) or 407\
   (Proxy Authentication Required) response is returned in order to\
   allow the requestor to insert appropriate credentials.\
\
\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
4.6.4.  Authorization Failure\
\
   If the RP actor receives an authenticated request with a namespace\
   and priority value it recognizes but the originator is not authorized\
   for that level of service, the element MUST return a 403 (Forbidden)\
   response.\
\
4.6.5.  Insufficient Resources\
\
   Insufficient resource conditions can occur on proxy servers and user\
   agent servers, typically trunk gateways, if an RP actor receives an\
   authorized request, has insufficient resources, and the request\
   neither preempts another session nor is queued.  A request can fail\
   because the RP actor has either insufficient processing capacity to\
   handle the SIP request or insufficient bandwidth or trunk capacity to\
   establish the requested session for session-creating SIP requests.\
\
   If the request fails because the RP actor cannot handle the signaling\
   load, the RP actor responds with 503 (Service Unavailable).\
\
   If there is not enough bandwidth, or if there is an insufficient\
   number of trunks, a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response indicates that\
   the RP actor is rejecting the request due to media path availability,\
   such as insufficient gateway resources.  In that case, [RFC3261]\
   advises that a 488 response SHOULD include a 'Warning' header field\
   with a reason for the rejection; warning code 370 (Insufficient\
   Bandwidth) is typical.\
\
   For systems implementing queueing, if the request is queued, the UAS\
   will return 408 (Request Timeout) if the request exceeds the maximum\
   configured waiting time in the queue.\
\
4.6.6.  Busy\
\
   Resource contention also occurs when a call request arrives at a UAS\
   that is unable to accept another call, because the UAS either has\
   just one line appearance or has active calls on all line appearances.\
   If the call request indicates an equal or lower priority value when\
   compared to all active calls present on the UAS, the UAS returns a\
   486 (Busy here) response.\
\
   If the request is queued instead, the UAS will return a 408 (Request\
   Timeout) if the request exceeds the maximum configured waiting time\
   in the device queue.\
\
   If a proxy gets 486 (Busy Here) responses on all branches, it can\
   then return a 600 (Busy Everywhere) response to the caller.\

\
\
4.7.  Element-Specific Behaviors\
\
4.7.1.  User Agent Client Behavior\
\
   SIP UACs supporting this specification MUST be able to generate the\
   'Resource-Priority' header field for requests that require elevated\
   resource access priority.  As stated previously, the UAC SHOULD be\
   able to generate more than one resource value in a single SIP\
   request.\
\
   Upon receiving a 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority) response, the UAC\
   MAY attempt a subsequent request with the same or different resource\
   value.  If available, it SHOULD choose authorized resource values\
   from the set of values returned in the 'Accept-Resource-Priority'\
   header field.\
\
4.7.1.1.  User Agent Client Behavior with a Preemption Algorithm\
\
   A UAC that requests a priority value that may cause preemption MUST\
   understand a Reason header field in the BYE request explaining why\
   the session was terminated, as discussed in [RFC4411].\
\
4.7.1.2.  User Agent Client Behavior with a Queueing Policy\
\
   By standard SIP protocol rules, a UAC MUST be prepared to receive a\
   182 (Queued) response from an RP actor that is currently at capacity,\
   but that has put the original request into a queue.  A UAC MAY\
   indicate this queued status to the user by some audio or visual\
   indication to prevent the user from interpreting the call as having\
   failed.\
\
4.7.2.  User Agent Server Behavior\
\
   The precise effect of the 'Resource-Priority' indication depends on\
   the type of UAS, the namespace, and local policy.\
\
4.7.2.1.  User Agent Servers and Preemption Algorithm\
\
   A UAS compliant with this specification MUST terminate a session\
   established with a valid namespace and lower-priority value in favor\
   of a new session set up with a valid namespace and higher relative\
   priority value, unless local policy has some form of call-waiting\
   capability enabled.  If a session is terminated, the BYE method is\
   used with a 'Reason' header field indicating why and where the\
   preemption took place.\
\
   Implementors have a number of choices in how to implement preemption\
   at IP phones with multiple line presences, i.e., with devices that\

\
   can handle multiple simultaneous sessions.  Naturally, if that device\
   has exhausted the number of simultaneous sessions, one of the\
   sessions needs to be replaced.  If the device has spare sessions, an\
   implementation MAY choose to alert the callee to the arrival of a\
   higher-priority call.  Details may also be set by local or namespace\
   policy.\
\
   [RFC4411] provides additional information in the case of purposeful\
   or administrative termination of a session by including the Reason\
   header in the BYE message that states why the BYE was sent (in this\
   case, a preemption event).  The mechanisms in that document allow\
   indication of where the termination occurred ('at the UA', 'within a\
   reservation', 'at a IP/PSTN gateway') and include call flow examples\
   of each reason.\
\
4.7.2.2.  User Agent Servers and Queue-Based Policy\
\
   A UAS compliant with this specification SHOULD generate a 182\
   (Queued) response if that element's resources are busy, until it is\
   able to handle the request and provide a final response.  The\
   frequency of such provisional messages is governed by [RFC3261].\
\
4.7.3.  Proxy Behavior\
\
   SIP proxies MAY ignore the 'Resource-Priority' header field.  SIP\
   proxies MAY reject any unauthenticated request bearing that header\
   field.\
\
   When the 'Require' header field is included in a message, it ensures\
   that in parallel forking, only branches that support the resource-\
   priority mechanism succeed.\
\
   If S/MIME encapsulation is used according to Section 23 of RFC 3261,\
   special considerations apply.  As tabulated in Section 3.3, the\
   'Resource-Priority' header field can be modified by proxies and thus\
   is exempted from the integrity checking described in Section 23.4.1.1\
   of RFC 3261.  Since it may need to be inspected or modified by\
   proxies, the header field MUST also be placed in the "outer" message\
   if the UAC would like proxy servers to be able to act on the header\
   information.  Similar considerations apply if parts of the message\
   are integrity protected or encrypted as described in [RFC3420].\
\
   If S/MIME is not used, or if the 'Resource-Priority' header field is\
   in the "outer" header, SIP proxies MAY downgrade or upgrade the\
   'Resource-Priority' of a request or insert a new 'Resource-Priority'\
   header if allowed by local policy.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   If a stateful proxy has authorized a particular resource priority\
   level, and if it offers differentiated treatment to responses\
   containing resource priority levels, the proxy SHOULD ignore any\
   higher value contained in responses, to prevent colluding user agents\
   from artificially raising the priority level.\
\
   A SIP proxy MAY use the 'Resource-Priority' indication in its routing\
   decisions, e.g., to retarget to a SIP node or SIP URI that is\
   reserved for a particular resource priority.\
\
   There are no special considerations for proxies when forking requests\
   containing a resource priority indication.\
\
   Otherwise, the proxy behavior is the same as for user agent servers\
   described in Section 4.7.2.\
\
5.  Third-Party Authentication\
\
   In some cases, the RP actor may not be able to authenticate the\
   requestor or determine whether an authenticated user is authorized to\
   make such a request.  In these circumstances, the SIP entity may\
   avail itself of general SIP mechanisms that are not specific to this\
   application.  The authenticated identity management mechanism\
   [RFC3893] allows a third party to verify the identity of the\
   requestor and to certify this towards an RP actor.  In networks with\
   mutual trust, the SIP-asserted identity mechanism [RFC3325] can help\
   the RP actor determine the identity of the requestor.\
\
6.  Backwards Compatibility\
\
   The resource priority mechanism described in this document is fully\
   backwards compatible with SIP systems following [RFC3261].  Systems\
   that do not understand the mechanism can only deliver standard, not\
   elevated, service priority.  User agent servers and proxies can\
   ignore any 'Resource-Priority' header field just like any other\
   unknown header field and then treat the request like any other\
   request.  Naturally, the request may still succeed.\
\
7.  Examples\
\
   The SDP message body and the BYE and ACK exchanges are the same as in\
   RFC 3665 [RFC3665] and are omitted for brevity.\

8.  Handling Multiple Concurrent Namespaces\
\
8.1.  General Rules\
\
   A single SIP request MAY contain resource values from multiple\
   namespaces.  As noted earlier, an RP actor disregards all namespaces\
   it does not recognize.  This specification only addresses the case\
   where an RP actor then selects one of the remaining resource values\
   for processing, usually choosing the one with the highest relative\
   priority.\
\
   If an RP actor understands multiple namespaces, it MUST create a\
   local total ordering across all resource values from these\
   namespaces, maintaining the relative ordering within each namespace.\
   It is RECOMMENDED that the same ordering be used across an\
   administrative domain.  However, there is no requirement that such\
   ordering be the same across all administrative domains.\
\
8.2.  Examples of Valid Orderings\
\
   Below are a set of examples of an RP actor that supports two\
   namespaces, foo and bar.  Foo's priority-values are 3 (highest), then\
   2, and then 1 (lowest), and bar's priority-values are C (highest),\
   then B, and then A (lowest).\
\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   Below are five lists of acceptable priority orders the SIP element\
   may use:\
\
       Foo.3        Foo.3       Bar.C    (highest priority)\
       Foo.2        Bar.C       Foo.3\
       Foo.1   or   Foo.2   or  Foo.2\
       Bar.C        Bar.B       Foo.1\
       Bar.B        Foo.1       Bar.B\
       Bar.A        Bar.A       Bar.A    (lowest priority)\
\
\
              Bar.C       (highest priority)\
           Foo.3  Bar.B   (both treated with equal priority (FIFO))\
    or     Foo.2  Bar.A   (both treated with equal priority (FIFO))\
              Foo.1       (lowest priority)\
\
\
           Bar.C     (highest priority)\
           Foo.3\
    or     Foo.2\
           Foo.1     (lowest priority)\
\
   In the last example above, Bar.A and Bar.B are ignored.\
\
8.3.  Examples of Invalid Orderings\
\
   Based on the priority order of the namespaces above, the following\
   combinations are examples of orderings that are NOT acceptable and\
   MUST NOT be configurable:\
\
          Example 1    Example 2   Example 3\
          ---------    ---------   ---------\
            Foo.3        Foo.3       Bar.C\
            Foo.2        Bar.A       Foo.1\
            Foo.1   or   Foo.2   or  Foo.3\
            Bar.C        Bar.B       Foo.2\
            Bar.A        Foo.1       Bar.A\
            Bar.B        Bar.C       Bar.B\
\
                 Example 4\
                 ---------\
                   Bar.C\
                Foo.1  Bar.B\
         or     Foo.3  Bar.A\
                   Foo.2\
\
\
\
\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   These examples are invalid since the following global orderings are\
   not consistent with the namespace-internal order:\
\
   o  In Example 1, Bar.A is ordered higher than Bar.B.\
\
   o  In Example 2, Bar.A is ordered higher than Bar.B and Bar.C.\
\
   o  In Example 3, Foo.1 is ordered higher than Foo.2 and Foo.3.\
\
   o  In Example 4, Foo.1 is ordered higher than Foo.3 and Foo.2.\
\
9.  Registering Namespaces\
\
   Organizations considering the use of the Resource-Priority header\
   field should investigate whether an existing combination of namespace\
   and priority-values meets their needs.  For example, emergency first\
   responders around the world are discussing utilizing this mechanism\
   for preferential treatment in future networks.  Jurisdictions SHOULD\
   attempt to reuse existing IANA registered namespaces where possible,\
   as a goal of this document is not to have unique namespaces per\
   jurisdiction serving the same purpose, with the same usage of\
   priority levels.  This will greatly increase interoperability and\
   reduce development time, and probably reduce future confusion if\
   there is ever a need to map one namespace to another in an\
   interworking function.\
\
   Below, we describe the steps necessary to register a new namespace.\
\
   A new namespace MUST be defined in a Standards Track RFC, following\
   the 'Standards Action' policy in [RFC2434], and MUST include the\
   following facets:\
\
   o  It must define the namespace label, a unique namespace label\
      within the IANA registry for the SIP Resource-Priority header\
      field.\
\
   o  It must enumerate the priority levels (i.e., 'r-priority' values)\
      the namespace is using.  Note that only finite lists are\
      permissible, not unconstrained integers or tokens, for example.\
\
   o  The priority algorithm (Section 4.5), identifying whether the\
      namespace is to be used with priority queueing ("queue") or\
      preemption ("preemption").  If queueing is used, the namespace MAY\
      indicate whether normal-priority requests are queued.  If there is\
      a new "intended algorithm" other than preemption or priority\
      queueing, the algorithm must be described, taking into account all\
      RP actors (UAC, UAS, proxies).\

\
RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   o  A namespace may either reference an existing list of priority\
      values or define a new finite list of priority values in relative\
      priority order for IANA registration within the sip-parameters\
      Resource-Priority priority-values registry.  New priority-values\
      SHOULD NOT be added to a previously IANA-registered list\
      associated with a particular namespace, as this may cause\
      interoperability problems.  Unless otherwise specified, it is\
      assumed that all priority values confer higher priority than\
      requests without a priority value.\
\
   o  Any new SIP response codes unique to this new namespace need to be\
      explained and registered.\
\
   o  The reference document must specify and describe any new Warning\
      header field warn-codes (RFC 3261, Section 27.2).\
\
   o  The document needs to specify a new row for the following table\
      that summarizes the features of the namespace and is included into\
      IANA Resource-Priority Namespace registration:\
\
                         Intended          New     New resp.\
   Namespace  Levels     algorithm      warn-code    code    Reference\
   ---------  ------  ----------------  ---------  --------  ---------\
    <label>   <# of    <preemption     <new warn  <new resp.  <RFC>\
             levels>    or queue>        code>      code>\
\
   If information on new response codes, rejection codes, or error\
   behaviors is omitted, it is to be assumed that the namespace defines\
   no new parameters or behaviors.\
\
10.  Namespace Definitions\
\
10.1.  Introduction\
\
   This specification defines five unique namespaces below: DSN, DRSN,\
   Q735, ETS, and WPS, constituting their registration with IANA.  Each\
   IANA registration contains the facets defined in Section 9.  For\
   recognizability, we label the namespaces in capital letters, but note\
   that namespace names are case insensitive and are customarily\
   rendered as lowercase in protocol requests.\
\
10.2.  The "DSN" Namespace\
\
   The DSN namespace comes from the name of a US government network\
   called "The Defense Switched Network".\
\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   The DSN namespace has a finite list of relative priority-values,\
   listed below from lowest priority to highest priority:\
\
      (lowest)  dsn.routine\
                dsn.priority\
                dsn.immediate\
                dsn.flash\
      (highest) dsn.flash-override\
\
   The DSN namespace uses the preemption algorithm (Section 4.5.1).\
\
10.3.  The "DRSN" Namespace\
\
   The DRSN namespace comes from the name of a US government network,\
   called "The Defense RED Switched Network".\
\
   The DRSN namespace defines the following resource values, listed from\
   lowest priority to highest priority:\
\
      (lowest)  drsn.routine\
                drsn.priority\
                drsn.immediate\

                drsn.flash-override\
      (highest) drsn.flash-override-override\
\
   The DRSN namespace uses the preemption algorithm (Section 4.5.1).\
\
   The DRSN namespace differs in one algorithmic aspect from the DSN and\
   Q735 namespaces.  The behavior for the 'flash-override-override'\
   priority value differs from the other values.  Normally, requests do\
   not preempt those of equal priority, but a newly arriving 'flash-\
   override-override' request will displace another one of equal\
   priority if there are insufficient resources.  This can also be\
   expressed as saying that 'flash-override-override' requests defend\
   themselves as 'flash-override' only.\
\
10.4.  The "Q735" Namespace\
\
   Q.735.3 [Q.735.3] was created to be a commercial version of the\
   operationally equivalent DSN specification for Multi-Level Precedence\
   and Preemption (MLPP).  The Q735 namespace is defined here in the\
   same manner.\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   The Q735 namespace defines the following resource values, listed from\
   lowest priority to highest priority:\
\
      (lowest)  q735.4\
                q735.3\
                q735.2\
                q735.1\
      (highest) q735.0\
\
   The Q735 namespace operates according to the preemption\
   (Section 4.5.1) algorithm.\
\
10.5.  The "ETS" Namespace\
\
   The ETS namespace derives its name indirectly from the name of the US\
   government telecommunications service, called "Government Emergency\
   Telecommunications Service" (or GETS), though the organization\
   responsible for the GETS service chose the acronym "ETS" for its GETS\
   over IP service, which stands for "Emergency Telecommunications\
   Service".\
\
   The ETS namespace defines the following resource values, listed from\
   lowest priority to highest priority:\
\
      (lowest)  ets.4\
                ets.3\
                ets.2\
                ets.1\
      (highest) ets.0\
\
   The ETS namespace operates according to the priority queueing\
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2).\
\
10.6.  The "WPS" Namespace\
\
   The WPS namespace derives its name from the "Wireless Priority\
   Service", defined in GSM and other wireless technologies.\
\
   The WPS namespace defines the following resource values, listed from\
   lowest priority to highest priority:\
\
      (lowest)  wps.4\
                wps.3\
                wps.2\
                wps.1\
      (highest) wps.0\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   The WPS namespace operates according to the priority queueing\
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2).\
\
11.  Security Considerations\
\
11.1.  General Remarks\
\
   Any resource priority mechanism can be abused to obtain resources and\
   thus deny service to other users.  An adversary may be able to take\
   over a particular PSTN gateway, cause additional congestion during\
   emergencies affecting the PSTN, or deny service to legitimate users.\
   In SIP end systems, such as IP phones, this mechanism could\
   inappropriately terminate existing sessions and calls.\
\
   Thus, while the indication itself does not have to provide separate\
   authentication, SIP requests containing this header are very likely\
   to have higher authentication requirements than those without.\
\
   These authentication and authorization requirements extend to users\
   within the administrative domain, as later interconnection with other\
   administrative domains may invalidate earlier assumptions on the\
   trustworthiness of users.\
\
   Below, we describe authentication and authorization aspects,\
   confidentiality and privacy requirements, protection against denial-\
   of-service attacks, and anonymity requirements.  Naturally, the\
   general discussion in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] applies.\
\
   All user agents and proxy servers that support this extension MUST\
   implement SIP over TLS [RFC3546], the 'sips' URI scheme as described\
   in Section 26.2 of RFC 3261, and Digest Authentication [RFC2617] as\
   described in Section 22 of RFC 3261.  In addition, user agents that\
   support this extension SHOULD also implement S/MIME [RFC3851] as\
   described in Section 23 of RFC 3261 to allow for signing and\
   verification of signatures over requests that use this extension.\
\
11.2.  Authentication and Authorization\
\
   Prioritized access to network and end-system resources imposes\
   particularly stringent requirements on authentication and\
   authorization mechanisms, since access to prioritized resources may\
   impact overall system stability and performance and not just result\
   in theft of, say, a single phone call.\
\
   Under certain emergency conditions, the network infrastructure,\
   including its authentication and authorization mechanism, may be\
   under attack.\
\

RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   Given the urgency during emergency events, normal statistical fraud\
   detection may be less effective, thus placing a premium on reliable\
   authentication.\
\
   Common requirements for authentication mechanisms apply, such as\
   resistance to replay, cut-and-paste, and bid-down attacks.\
\
   Authentication MAY be SIP based or use other mechanisms.  Use of\
   Digest authentication and/or S/MIME is RECOMMENDED for UAS\
   authentication.  Digest authentication requires that the parties\
   share a common secret, thus limiting its use across administrative\
   domains.  SIP systems employing resource priority SHOULD implement\
   S/MIME at least for integrity, as described in Section 23 of\
   [RFC3261].  However, in some environments, receipt of asserted\
   identity [RFC3325] from a trusted entity may be sufficient\
   authorization.  Section 5 describes third-party authentication.\
\
   Trait-based authorization [TRAIT] "entails an assertion by a\
   authorization service of attributes associated with an identity" and\
   may be appropriate for this application.  With trait-based\
   authorization, a network element can directly determine, by\
   inspecting the certificate, that a request is authorized to obtain a\
   particular type of service, without having to consult a mapping\
   mechanism that converts user identities to authorizations.\
\
   Authorization may be based on factors besides the identity of the\
   caller, such as the requested destination.  Namespaces MAY also\
   impose particular authentication or authorization considerations that\
   are stricter than the baseline described here.\
\
11.3.  Confidentiality and Integrity\
\
   Calls that use elevated resource priority levels provided by the\
   'Resource-Priority' header field are likely to be sensitive and often\
   need to be protected from intercept and alteration.  In particular,\
   requirements for protecting the confidentiality of communications\
   relationships may be higher than those for normal commercial service.\
   For SIP, the 'To', 'From', 'Organization', and 'Subject' header\
   fields are examples of particularly sensitive information.  Systems\
   MUST implement encryption at the transport level using TLS and MAY\
   implement other transport-layer or network-layer security mechanisms.\
   UACs SHOULD use the "sips" URI to request a secure transport\
   association to the destination.\
\
   The 'Resource-Priority' header field can be carried in the SIP\
   message header or can be encapsulated in a message fragment carried\
   in the SIP message body [RFC3420].  To be considered valid\
   authentication for the purposes of this specification, S/MIME-signed\
\
\
\
Schulzrinne & Polk          Standards Track                    [Page 28]\
\
RFC 4412                 SIP Resource Priority             February 2006\
\
\
   SIP messages or fragments MUST contain, at a minimum, the Date, To,\
   From, Call-ID, and Resource-Priority header fields.  Encapsulation in\
   S/MIME body parts allows the user to protect this header field\
   against inspection or modification by proxies.  However, in many\
   cases, proxies will need to authenticate and authorize the request,\
   so encapsulation would be undesirable.\
\
   Removal of a Resource-Priority header field or downgrading its\
   priority value affords no additional opportunities to an adversary,\
   since that man-in-the-middle could simply drop or otherwise\
   invalidate the SIP request and thus prevent call completion.\
\
   Only SIP elements within the same administrative trust domain\
   employing a secure channel between their SIP elements will trust a\
   Resource-Priority header field that is not appropriately signed.\
   Others will need to authenticate the request independently.  Thus,\
   insertion of a Resource-Priority header field or upgrading the\
   priority value has no further security implications except causing a\
   request to fail (see discussion in the previous paragraph).\
\
11.4.  Anonymity\
\
   Some users may wish to remain anonymous to the request destination.\
   Anonymity for requests with resource priority is no different from\
   that for any other authenticated SIP request.  For the reasons noted\
   earlier, users have to authenticate themselves towards the SIP\
   elements carrying the request where they desire resource priority\
   treatment.  The authentication may be based on capabilities and noms,\
   not necessarily their civil name.  Clearly, they may remain anonymous\
   towards the request destination, using the network-asserted identity\
   and general privacy mechanism described in [RFC3323].\
\
11.5.  Denial-of-Service Attacks\
\
   As noted, systems described here are likely to be subject to\
   deliberate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks during certain types of\
   emergencies.  DoS attacks may be launched on the network itself as\
   well as on its authentication and authorization mechanism.  As noted,\
   systems should minimize the amount of state, computation, and network\
   resources that an unauthorized user can command.  The system must not\
   amplify attacks by causing the transmission of more than one packet\
   to a network address whose reachability has not been verified.\

\
12.  IANA Considerations\
\
12.1.  Introduction\
\
   This section defines two new SIP headers (Section 12.2), one SIP\
   option tag (Section 12.3), one new 4xx error code (Section 12.4), a\
   new registry within the sip-parameters section of IANA for Resource-\
   Priority namespaces (Section 12.5), and a new registry within the\
   sip-parameters section of IANA for Resource-Priority and priority-\
   values (Section 12.6).\
\
   Additional namespaces and priority values MUST be registered with\
   IANA, as described in Section 9.\
\
   The SIP Change Process [RFC3427] establishes a policy for the\
   registration of new SIP extension headers.  Resource priority\
   namespaces and priority values have similar interoperability\
   requirements to those of SIP extension headers.  Consequently,\
   registration of new resource priority namespaces and priority values\
   requires documentation in an RFC using the extension header approval\
   process specified in RFC 3427.\
\
   Registration policies for new namespaces are defined in Section 9.\
\
12.2.  IANA Registration of 'Resource-Priority' and 'Accept-Resource-\
       Priority' Header Fields\
\
   The following is the registration for the 'Resource-Priority' header\
   field:\
\
   RFC number: 4412\
   Header name: 'Resource-Priority'\
   Compact form: none\
\
   The following is the registration for the 'Accept-Resource-Priority'\
   header field:\
\
   RFC number: 4412\
   Header name: Accept-Resource-Priority\
   Compact form: none\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\
   In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or\
   monitor Multiprotocol Label Switching Layer-3 Virtual Private\
   Networks on a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switching\
   Router (LSR) supporting this feature.\
\
   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms\
   described in [RFC4364].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of\
   [RFC4364] apply and will not be re-described here.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\

\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS\
   architecture [RFC3031] and from the document describing MPLS Layer-3\
   VPNs (L3VPN) [RFC4364], as well as the MPLS architecture [RFC3031].\
\
   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)\
   and Customer Edge (CE)" or "PE/CE" will be replaced by "PE" in all\
   cases except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier's\
   carrier model.\
\
3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\
\
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current\
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of\
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\
\
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).\
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the\
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\
   [RFC2580].\
\
4.  Assumptions and Prerequisites\
\
   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in\
   order for the tables and objects described in this MIB to function\
   correctly.  These things are outlined below:\
\
   - MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.\
\
   - Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) paths or traffic-engineered\
     tunnels [RFC3812] should be configured between PEs and CEs.\
\
5.  Brief Description of MIB Objects\
\
     The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the\
     objects contained in the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB.\
\
5.1.  mplsL3VpnVrfTable\
\
     This table represents the MPLS L3VPNs that are configured.  A\
     Network Management System (NMS) or SNMP agent creates an entry in\
     this table for every MPLS L3VPN configured on the LSR being\
     examined.  The Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) that is\
\

RFC 4382                   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB              February 2006\
\
\
     configured at a particular device represents an instance of some\
     VPN, but not the entire VPN (unless it is the only VRF, of course).\
     The collective set of VRF instances comprises the actual VPN.  This\
     information is typically only known in its entirety at the NMS.\
     That is, specific devices generally only know of their local VRF\
     information, but not that of other LSRs' VRFs.\
\
5.2.  mplsL3VpnIfConfTable\
\
     This table represents the MPLS L3VPN-enabled interfaces that are\
     associated with a specific VRF as represented in the aforementioned\
     mplsL3VpnVrfTable.  Each entry in this table corresponds to an\
     entry in the Interfaces MIB.  In addition, each entry extends its\
     corresponding entry in the Interfaces MIB to contain specific MPLS\
     L3VPN information.  Due to this correspondence, certain objects\
     such as traffic counters are not found in this MIB to avoid\
     overlap, but instead are found in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].\
\
5.3.  mplsL3VpnVrfPerfTable\
\
     This table contains objects to measure the performance of MPLS\
     L3VPNs and augments the mplsL3VpnVrfTable.  High capacity counters\
     are provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on\
     objects such as high-speed interface counters.\
\
5.4.  mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable\
\
     The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor\
     routes used by a particular VRF.  This includes a cross-connect\
     pointer into the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB's mplsXCTable, which may be used\
     to refer that entry to its label stack used to label switch that\
     entry.\
\
5.5.  MplsVpnVrfRTTable\
\
     The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor\
     route targets for a particular VRF.\
\
6.  Example of MPLS L3VPN Setup\
\
     In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB\
     objects described in the following section.  While this example is\
     not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended as\
     an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is our intent\
     that it is read only after the reader has gone through the MIB\
     itself.\

\
     This configuration is under the assumption that 1) MPLS has been\
     pre-configured in the network, through enabling LDP or Resource\
     Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE); 2) OSPF or\
     Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) has been pre-\
     configured; and 3) BGP sessions have been established between PEs.\

     mplsL3VpnVrfRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)\
   }\
\
   In mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable:\
   {\
     mplsL3VpnVrfRTRowStatus."Red"."100:1".import = createAndGo,\

\
\
   DESCRIPTION\
     "Denotes the interval in seconds, at which the route max threshold\
      notification may be reissued after the maximum value has been\
      exceeded (or has been reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and\
      mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial\

      continuous generation of notifications by an agent in the event\
      that routes are continually added to a VRF after it has reached\
      its maximum value.  If this value is set to 0, the agent should\
      only issue a single notification at the time that the maximum\

\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for\
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs supporting L3 MPLS VPN.  This MIB module can\
   also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that\
   can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially\
   disastrous results.\
\
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on\
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their\
   sensitivity/vulnerability:\
\
   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable, and\
        mplsL3VpnVrfTable tables collectively contain objects that may\
        be used to provision MPLS VRF interfaces and configuration.\
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in\
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true\
        if these VRFs have been previously provisioned and are in use.\
\

RFC 4382                   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB              February 2006\
\
\
        The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be\
        considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM\
        MUST be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.\
        Administrators should consider whether read access to these\
        objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable\
        under certain circumstances.\
\
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\
   sensitivity/vulnerability:\
\
   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable tables collectively\
        show the VRF interfaces and associated VRF configurations as\
        well as their linkages to other MPLS-related configuration\
        and/or performance statistics.  Administrators not wishing to\
        reveal this information should consider these objects\
        sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not\
        revealed.\
\
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\
   in this MIB module.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\
   authentication and privacy).\
\
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to\
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\

9.  IANA Considerations\
\
   As described in MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related standards\
   track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.\
   There is one MPLS-related MIB module contained in this document.  The\
   following subsection requests IANA for a new assignment under the\
   mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards\
   Action as specified in [RFC2434].\
\
9.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB\
\
   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB\
   module specified in this document.\

RFC 4414              ENUM Registry Type for IRIS          February 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document describes an IRIS registry schema for registries of\
   ENUM data using an XML Schema [4] derived from and using the IRIS [5]\
   schema.\
\
   The schema given is this document is specified using the Extensible\
   Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in XML [1], XML Schema\
   notation as described in XML_SD [3] and XML_SS [4], and XML\
   Namespaces as described in XML_NS [2].\
\
2.  Document Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [10].\
\
   This document uses the term "ENUM" as the fully qualified domain name\
   following the conventions of ENUM [17].\
\
3.  Schema Description\
\
   IRIS requires the derivation of both query and result elements by a\
   registry schema.  These descriptions follow.\
\
   References to XML elements with no namespace qualifier are from the\
   schema defined in Section 4.  References to elements and attributes\
   with the "iris" XML namespace qualifier are from the schema defined\
   in IRIS [5].\
\
   The descriptions contained within this section refer to XML elements\
   and attributes and their relation to the exchange of data within the\
   protocol.  These descriptions also contain specifications outside the\
   scope of the formal XML syntax.  Therefore, this section will use\
   terms defined by RFC 2119 [10] to describe the specification outside\
   the scope of the formal XML syntax.  While reading this section,\
   please reference Section 4 for needed details on the formal XML\
   syntax.\
\
3.1.  Query Derivatives\
\
3.1.1.  <findEnumsByE164> Query\
\
   <findEnumsByE164> finds ENUM domains by searching on prefixes of\
   E.164 numbers and returns <enum> (Section 3.2.3) results.\
\
   The E.164 prefix is specified using the <e164Prefix> child of\
   <findEnumsByE164>.  An optional child element of <findEnumsByE164>,\

RFC 4414              ENUM Registry Type for IRIS          February 2006\
\
\
   <specificity>, can narrow the search to ENUM domains associated with\
   E.164 numbers that are either more specific or less specific.  If the\
   <specificity> element is present and has the content 'less', then the\
   search is to be narrowed to E.164 numbers that are less specific\
   (i.e., have fewer digits).  If the <specificity> element is present\
   and has the content 'more', then the search is to be narrowed to\
   E.164 numbers that are more specific (i.e., have more digits).\
\
3.1.2.  <findEnumsByContact> Query\
\
   <findEnumsByContact> finds ENUM domains by searches on fields\
   associated with an ENUM domain's contact.\
\
   The allowable search fields are handled with either the\
   <contactHandle> element or one of the elements in the\
   "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.5).  The <contactHandle>\
   element allows for the ENUM domains to be selected based on the\
   contact having the specified contact handle.\
\
   The query MAY also be constrained further using the optional <role>\
   element.  The contents of this element signify the role the contact\
   has with the ENUM domain.\
\
   This query also provides optional <language> elements containing\
   language tags.  Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about\
   the natural language(s) of the affected element.  Servers MAY use\
   this information in processing the query, such as tailoring\
   normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.\
\
3.1.3.  <findContacts> Query\
\
   <findContacts> searches for contacts given search constraints.\
\
   The allowable search fields are handled by one of the elements in the\
   "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.5).\
\
   This query also provides optional <language> elements containing\
   language tags.  Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about\
   the natural language(s) of the affected element.  Servers MAY use\
   this information in processing the query, such as tailoring\
   normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.\
\
3.1.4.  <findEnumsByHost> Query\
\
   This query does a simple search for the ENUM domains being hosted by\
   a name server.  The search is constrained using either the host name\
   [12], host handle, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address of the name server.\

\
\
3.1.5.  Contact Search Group\
\
   Some of the queries above have similar query constraints for\
   searching on contacts.  This section describes those common\
   parameters.\
\
   <commonName> allows the query to be constrained based on the common\
   name of the contact.  The constraint can either constrain the query\
   by an exact match using the <exactMatch> element, or it may constrain\
   the query by a subset of the common name using the <beginsWith> and\
   <endsWith> elements.\
\
   <organization> allows the query to be constrained based on the\
   organization name of the contact.  It has the same semantics as the\
   <commonName> element.\
\
   <eMail> constrains the query based on the e-mail address of the\
   contact.  This may be done by an exact e-mail address using the\
   <exactMatch> element or by any e-mail address in a domain using the\
   <inDomain> element.  The <inDomain> MUST only contain a valid domain\
   name (i.e., no '@' symbol), and the matching SHOULD take place only\
   on the domain given (i.e., no partial matches with respect to\
   substrings or parent domains).  If either the contents of the\
   <inDomain> element or domain part of the contents of the <exactMatch>\
   element contain a name with non-ASCII characters, they MUST be\
   normalized according to the processes of RFC 3491 [15].\
\
   The <city>, <region>, and <postalCode> elements restrict the scope of\
   the query based on the city, region, or postal code of the contact,\
   respectively.  Each one must only contain an <exactMatch> element\
   containing the exact city, region, or postal code (i.e., no substring\
   searches).\
\
3.2.  Result Derivatives\
\
3.2.1.  Privacy Labels\
\
   Several of the results in this registry type have values that cannot\
   be given but must be specified as present or must be flagged so that\
   clients do not divulge them.  In order to achieve this, some of the\
   results use the following element types:\
\
   o  "dateTimePrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type\
      "dateTime".  The contents of this element MUST be specified using\
      the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\
\
   o  "stringPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type\
      "string".\

RFC 4414              ENUM Registry Type for IRIS          February 2006\
\
\
   o  "normalizedStringPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data\
      type "normalizedString".\
\
   o  "tokenPrivacyType" - contains the XML Schema [3] data type\
      "token".\
\
   o  "enumStatusType" - describes a state for an ENUM domain.  This\
      element has the following optional attributes:\
\
      *  'scope' - indicates the scope or origin of the status value.\
\
      *  'disposition' - contains either the value "pending", meaning\
         that initial processing for this status has begun and is not\
         yet complete, or the value "prohibited", meaning this ENUM\
         domain cannot achieve this status according to either the\
         registry or registrar of this ENUM domain.\
\
      *  'actor' - contains either the value "registry", meaning this\
         status value has been associated with this ENUM domain by the\
         registry, or the value "registrar", meaning this status value\
         has been associated with this ENUM domain by the registrar.\
\
      This element has the following optional child elements:\
\
      *  <appliedDate> - indicates the date and time the status was\
         applied.\
\
      *  <description> - provides a textual description of the status.\
         This element has a required 'language' attribute.\
\
      *  <subStatus> - indicates a jurisdictional-dependent reason for\
         this status value.  This element has a required 'authority'\
         attribute to indicate the jurisdictional authority associated\
         with this sub-status.\
\
   o  "contactTypeType" - contains an optional <description> child\
      elements.  Each <description> child element requires a 'language'\
      attribute.\
\
   As specified, they are nillable and therefore may be present with\
   empty content or present with their specified content.  The use of\
   these elements is also optional.\
\
   If present without content, each of these element types MUST have one\
   or more of the following boolean attributes:\
\
   o  'private' - if true, this specifies that the content is absent\
      because it may never be published.\
\

RFC 4414              ENUM Registry Type for IRIS          February 2006\
\
\
   o  'denied' - if true, this specifies that the content is absent\
      because policy does not allow it to be given under the current\
      level of access.\
\
   If present with content, each of these element types MAY have one or\
   more of the following boolean attributes:\
\
   o  'doNotRedistribute' - if true, this specifies that the content is\
      not to be redistributed.\
\
   o  'specialAccess' - if true, this specifies that the content has\
      been provided due to special access rights.\
\
   These boolean attributes SHOULD be used in accordance with the level\
   of access being granted the recipient of the data.  For example,\
   marking data as 'private' or 'denied' is to be expected if the user\
   is anonymous or has some other low level of access that does not\
   warrant viewing of that particular data.  Likewise, data marked with\
   'doNotRedistribute' or 'specialAccess' is to be expected if the user\
   is authenticated and has a high level of access.\
\
3.2.2.  Contact Group\
\
   Many of the results share a set of references to contacts regarding\
   an associated role.  These are represented by the following elements:\
\
   o  <billingContact>\
\
   o  <technicalContact>\
\
   o  <administrativeContact>\
\
   o  <legalContact>\
\
   o  <zoneContact>\
\
   o  <abuseContact>\
\
   o  <securityContact>\
\
   o  <otherContact>\
\
   Each of these elements contains an entity reference.  The referent of\
   each MUST be a <contact> (Section 3.2.5).\

   language tags that allow a client to suggest to a server the\
   languages in which to scope the queries.  If a client passes to the\
   server a language that the server does not support, the server MAY\
   use this error code to indicate that one of the languages is not\
   supported.\
\
   This element contains child elements named <unsupportedLanguage>.\
   Each of these child elements specifies a language not supported by\
   the server.  When a server returns this error, it MUST give the\
   languages from the query that are not supported.\

\
   The following types of entity classes are recognized by the\
   <lookupEntity> query of IRIS for this registry:\
\
   o  host-name - the fully qualified domain name of a nameserver.  It\
      yields a <host> (Section 3.2.4) in the response.\
\
   o  host-handle - the registry-unique identifier given a nameserver.\

\
   o  e164 - an E.164 number as specified by [13].  It yields an <enum>\
      (Section 3.2.3) in the response.  Clients SHOULD remove all non-\
      digit characters between the digits of an E.164 number, and\
      servers MUST ignore any non-digit characters between the digits of\
      an E.164 number (e.g., "+1 703 555 1234" is to be interpreted as\
      "+17035551234").\
\
   o  enum - the fully qualified name of an ENUM domain.  This is a\
      domain name as specified by RFC 3761 [17].  It yields an <enum>\
      (Section 3.2.3) in the response.\
\
   o  enum-handle - the registry-unique identifier given an ENUM domain.\
      It yields an <enum> (Section 3.2.3) in the response.\
\
   o  contact-handle - the registry-unique identifier given a contact.\
      It yields a <contact> (Section 3.2.5) in the response.\
\
   o  ipv4-address - the IPv4 address of a nameserver.  It yields a\
      <host> (Section 3.2.4) in the response.\
\
   o  ipv6-address - the IPv6 address of a nameserver.  It yields a\
      <host> (Section 3.2.4) in the response.\
\
   o  registration-authority - the name of a registration authority.  It\
      yields a <registrationAuthority> (Section 3.2.6) in the response.\
\
   o  validation-entity - the name of a validation entity.  It yields a\
      <validationEntity> (Section 3.2.7)\
\
   o  csp - the identifier of a communication service provider.  Yields\
      a <communicationServiceProvider> (Section 3.2.8).\
\
   o  validation-event - the identifier for a validation event.  It\
      yields a <validationEvent> (Section 3.2.9).\
\
   o  All names in these entity classes are case insensitive.\

\
5.  Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) Transport Compliance\
\
   IRIS allows several extensions of the core capabilities.  This\
   section outlines those extensions allowable by IRIS-BEEP [6].\
\
5.1.  Message Pattern\
\
   This registry type uses the default message pattern as described in\
   IRIS-BEEP [6].\
\
5.2.  Server Authentication\
\
   This registry type only uses the basic Transport Layer Security (TLS)\
   server authentication method as described in IRIS-BEEP [6].\
\
6.  URI Resolution\
\
6.1.  Application Service Label\
\
   The application service label associated with this registry type MUST\
   be "EREG1".  This is the abbreviated form of the URN for this\
   registry type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ereg1.\
\
7.  Internationalization Considerations\
\
   Implementers should be aware of considerations for\
   internationalization in IRIS [5].\
\
   The social data associated with contacts may be non-ASCII, and could\
   contain virtually any Unicode character.  The <language> element is\
   provided in queries that have potential to traverse such data.\
   Clients should use these elements to indicate to the server of the\
   target languages desired, and servers should use these elements to\
   better enable normalization and search processes (see\
   <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/>).\
\
   Clients needing to localize the data tags in this protocol should\
   take note that localization is only needed on the names of XML\
   elements and attributes with the exception of elements containing\
   date and time information.  The schema for this registry has been\
   designed so that clients need not interpret the content of elements\
\

RFC 4414              ENUM Registry Type for IRIS          February 2006\
\
\
   or attributes for localization, other than those elements containing\
   date and time information.\
\
   Clients should also make use of the <language> elements provided in\
   many of the results.  Results containing data that may be in Unicode\
   are accompanied by these elements in order to aid better presentation\
   of the data to the user.\
\
   The "dateTimePrivacyType" element content conforms to the XML Schema\
   [3] data type "dateTime".  The contents of this element MUST be\
   specified using the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time\
   (UTC).\
\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
8.1.  XML Namespace URN Registration\
\
   This document makes use of a proposed XML namespace and schema\
   registry specified in XML_URN [16].  Accordingly, the following\
   registration information is provided for the IANA:\
\
   o  URN/URI:\
\
      *  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:ereg1\
\
   o  Contact:\
\
      *  Andrew Newton <andy@hxr.us>\
\
   o  XML:\
\
      *  The XML Schema specified in Section 4\
\
   o  URN/URI:\
\
      *  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ereg1\
\
   o  Contact:\
\
      *  Andrew Newton <andy@hxr.us>\
\
   o  XML:\
\
      *  None.\

\
\
8.2.  S-NAPTR Registration\
\
   The following S-NAPTR application service tag [20] has been\
   registered with IANA according to the IANA considerations defined in\
   IRIS [5]:\
\
      EREG1\
\
8.3.  BEEP Registration\
\
   The following BEEP Profile URI has been registered with IANA\
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/beep-parameters), in addition to the\
   registration provided in IRIS-BEEP [6].\
\
      http://iana.org/beep/iris1/ereg1\
\
9.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document lays out no new considerations for security precautions\
   beyond that specified in IRIS [5].\

\
Abstract\
\
   The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport\
   protocol, intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort\
   messages in an any-to-any multicast environment, where the best-\
   effort traffic occurs in significantly greater volume than the\
   reliable traffic and therefore can carry sequence numbers of reliable\
   messages for loss detection.  SRMP is intended for use in a\
   distributed simulation application environment, where only the latest\
   value of reliable transmission for any particular data identifier\
   requires delivery.  SRMP has two sublayers: a bundling sublayer\
   handling message aggregation and congestion control, and a\
   Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer.  Selection between\
   reliable and best-effort messages is performed by the application.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   There is no viable generic approach to achieving reliable transport\
   over multicast networks.  Existing successful approaches require that\
   the transport protocol take advantage of special properties of the\
   traffic in a way originally proposed by Cohen [10].  The protocol\
   described here is applicable to real-time traffic containing a mix of\
   two categories of messages: a small fraction requiring reliable\
   delivery, mixed with a predominating flow of best-effort messages.\
   This sort of traffic is associated with distributed virtual\
   simulation (RFC 2502 [4]) and also with some forms of distributed\
   multimedia conferencing.  These applications typically have some data\
   that changes rarely, or not at all, so the best efficiency will be\
   achieved by transmitting that data reliably (the external appearance\
   of a simulated vehicle is an excellent example).  They also require\
   real-time transmission of a best-effort stream (for example, the\
   position and orientation of the vehicle).  There is no value to\
   reliable transmission of this stream because typically new updates\
   arrive faster than loss identification and retransmission could take\
   place.  By piggy-backing the sequence number (SN) of the latest\
   reliable transmission on each bundle of traffic, the reliable and\
   best-effort traffic can co-exist synergistically.  This approach is\
   implemented in the Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP).\
\
   The IETF has conducted a successful working group on Reliable\
   Multicast Transport (RMT) that has produced RFCs 2357 [6], 2887 [11],\
   and 3450 through 3453 [12 - 15], which define building block\
   protocols for reliable multicast.  Selectively reliable multicast is\
   similar in spirit to these protocols and in fact uses one of them,\
   TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC).  This document\
   provides the basis for specifying SRMP with TFMCC for use on an\
   experimental basis.  Key requirements of the RMT process that is\
   carried forward here are specified in RFC 2357 [6].  These generally\
   relate to scalability and congestion control, and are addressed in\
   section 6 of this document.\

\
2.  Protocol Description\
\
   The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) has two major\
   components: Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) and a "bundling\
   sublayer" that implements TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control\
   (TFMCC), as proposed by Widmer and Handley [2], in order to meet the\
   requirements of RFC 2357 [6] for congestion avoidance.\
\
   SRMP is capable of reliable message delivery over multicast networks,\
   when the messages to be delivered reliably represent a fraction of a\
   larger, associated best-effort flow and only the latest reliable\
   message must be delivered.  The basic strategy for SRMP is to trade\
   as little network capacity as possible for reliability by buffering\
   the most recently sent reliable message at each sender and piggy-\
   backing its sequence number on associated best-effort messages.  For\
   this purpose, three modes of sending are defined:\
\
   o  Mode 0 messages.  These will be delivered best-effort; if lost, no\
      retransmission will be done.\
\
   o  Mode 1 messages.  When a Mode 1 message loss is detected, the\
      receiver will send back a NACK to the sender, where SRMP will\
      retransmit the latest reliable message from that sender.  Senders\
      define data identifiers (dataIDs), allowing multiple reliable\
      message streams to be supported.  Mode 1 messages may be up to\
      131,071 bytes long; SRMP provides for segmentation and reassembly,\
      but only for the latest Mode 1 message for any given\
      <sourceAddress, multicastAddress, dataID>.\
\
   o  Mode 2 messages.  Through Mode 2 messages, SRMP provides for a\
      lightweight, reliable, connectionless peer-to-peer unicast\
      transaction exchange between any two members of the multicast\
      group.  This is a unicast message requiring positive\
      acknowledgement (ACK).\
\
      | Application   |\
      -----------------       ----------\
      |      SRT      |\
      -----------------   ->     SRMP\
      |Bundling(TFMCC)|\
      -----------------       ----------\
      |      UDP      |\
\
   The bundling sublayer is transparent to the Selectively Reliable\
   Transport (SRT) sublayer.  It implements congestion control both by\
   dropping Mode 0 messages at the source when needed and by bundling\
   multiple short messages that are presented by applications within a\
   short time window.  It also performs NACK suppression.\

RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   A bundling sublayer data unit is called a bundle.  A bundle is made\
   up of a bundle header and one or more Mode 0 and Mode 1 SRMP\
   messages.  Retransmission of Mode 1 messages does not imply\
   retransmission of the original bundle; the retransmitted message\
   becomes part of a new bundle.\
\
   The TFMCC layer's behavior follows the mechanism described by Widmer\
   and Handley.  This is an equation-based multicast congestion control\
   mechanism: in a multicast group, each receiver determines its loss\
   rate with regard to the sender, and calculates a desired source\
   sending rate based on an equation that models the steady-state\
   sending rate of TCP.  A distributed feedback suppression mechanism\
   restricts feedback to those receivers likely to report the lowest\
   desired rates.  Congestion control is achieved by dropping best-\
   effort (Mode 0) messages at random.  For example, in distributed\
   simulation, Mode 0 messages are part of a stream of state updates for\
   dynamic data such as geographic location; therefore, the application\
   can continue to function (with lower fidelity) when they are dropped.\
\
   As described by its authors, TFMCC's congestion control mechanism\
   works as follows:\
\
   o  Each receiver measures the loss event rate and its Round-Trip Time\
      (RTT) to the sender.\
\
   o  Each receiver then uses this information, together with an\
      equation for TCP throughput, to derive a TCP-friendly sending\
      rate.\
\
   o  Through a distributed feedback suppression mechanism, only a\
      subset of the receivers is allowed to give feedback to prevent a\
      feedback implosion at the sender.  The feedback mechanism ensures\
      that receivers reporting a low desired transmission rate have a\
      high probability of sending feedback.\
\
   o  Receivers whose feedback is not suppressed report the calculated\
      transmission rate back to the sender in so-called receiver\
      reports.  The receiver reports serve two purposes: they inform the\
      sender about the appropriate transmit rate, and they allow the\
      receivers to measure their RTT.\
\
   o  The sender selects the receiver that reports the lowest rate as\
      the current limiting receiver (CLR).  Whenever feedback with an\
      even lower rate reaches the sender, the corresponding receiver\
      becomes the CLR and the sending rate is reduced to match that\
      receiver's calculated rate.  The sending rate increases when the\
      CLR reports a calculated rate higher than the current sending\
      rate.\

\
\
   TFMCC was intended for fixed-size packets with variable rate.  SRMP\
   applies it to variable-size SRMP messages that are mostly the same\
   size because the best-effort updates typically all represent the same\
   sort of simulation information and are grouped into bundles of size\
   just under one MTU during periods of heavy network activity.  Future\
   developments in TFMCC for variable-size messages will be of high\
   value for inclusion in SRMP if, as expected, they prove to be\
   appropriate for the types of traffic SRMP is intended to support.\
\
   SRMP is intended for general use under applications that need its\
   services and may exist in parallel instances on the same host.  The\
   UDP port is therefore established ad hoc from available application\
   ports; accordingly, it would not be appropriate to have a well-known\
   port for SRMP.\
\
3.  Message Formats\
\
3.1.  Bundle Message Format:\
\
   --------------------------------------------------------------------\
   | bundle header | SRT Message 0 | SRT message 1 | SRT message 2 |...\
   --------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
   A bundle is an aggregation of multiple SRMP messages destined for the\
   same multicast address.  A bundle can contain only Mode 0 and Mode 1\
   messages; Mode 2 messages are exchanged using unicast addresses.\
\
   SRMP identifies the sender and receiver using their 32-bit Sender_ID,\
   which may be an IPv4 address.  For use with IPv6, a user group will\
   need to establish a unique identifier per host.  There is no\
   requirement for this identifier to be unique in the Internet; it only\
   needs to be unique in the communicating group.\

   Note that the number of DSNs reflects the number of different Mode 1\
   DataIDs being supported at this time by this instance of SRMP, and is\
   not the count of SRMP messages bundled in this transmission.\
\
   Note also that 16-bit timestamps will wrap around in 65536\
   milliseconds.  This should not be a problem unless an RTT is greater\
   than 65 seconds. If a timestamp is less than its predecessor\
   (treating the 16 bits as an unsigned integer), its value must be\
   increased by 65536 for comparisons against the predecessor.\

\
4.  TFMCC Operation\
\
4.1.  TCP Rate Prediction Equation for TFMCC\
\
   The RECOMMENDED throughput equation for SRMP is a slightly simplified\
   version of the throughput equation for Reno TCP from [5]:\
\
                                      8*s\
      X = ------------------------------------------------------   (1)\
            R * (sqrt(2*p/3) + (3*sqrt(6*p) * p * (1+32*p^2)))\
\
   (the formula may be simplified for implementation), where\
\
      X is the transmit rate in bits/second.\
\
      s is the message size in bytes.\
\
      R is the round-trip time in seconds.\
\
      p is the loss event rate, between 0.0 and 1.0, of the number of\
        loss events as a fraction of the number of messages transmitted.\
\
   In the future, different TCP formulas may be substituted for this\
   equation.  The requirement is that the throughput equation be a\
   reasonable approximation of the sending rate of TCP for conformant\
   TCP congestion control.\
\
4.2.  Bundling\
\
   Multiple SRMP messages will be encapsulated into a bundle.  When a\
   new SRMP message (Mode 0 or Mode 1) arrives, the SRMP daemon will try\
   to add the new message into the current bundle.\
\
   The SRMP daemon MUST keep a timer, which will be reset when the first\
   SRMP message is added into the bundle.  After Bundle_Timeout, the\
   timer will time out, and the current bundle should be transmitted\
\
\
\
Pullen, et al.                Experimental                     [Page 13]\
\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   immediately.  A new bundle will then be initialized to hold new SRMP\
   messages.  Bundle_Timeout SHALL NOT be less than 1 ms.  The\
   recommended value is 10 ms.\
\
   Also, the bundle length MUST NOT exceed LENGTH_MAX.  If adding a new\
   SRMP message will produce a greater length, the SRMP daemon MUST\
   initialize a new bundle for the new SRMP messages, and the current\
   bundle should be transmitted immediately.  The recommended value for\
   LENGTH_MAX is 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU minus IP and UDP header\
   lengths).\
\
   In a bundle, there may exist multiple SRMP messages with the same\
   dataID.  In this case, only the latest version of that dataID is\
   useful.  SRMP may check for duplicate dataIDs in the same bundle and\
   delete all but the latest one.  If a Mode 1 message appears in the\
   outgoing bundle, then the corresponding DSN should not appear in the\
   bundle header.\
\
   The bundle header contains the DSN <dataID,SN,NoSegs> for Mode 1\
   messages from this sender.  The absolute maximum number of DSN is\
   255; however, an implementation may apply a user-specified DSN_Max,\
   no smaller than 1.  An implementation may support a user-defined\
   dataID_Timeout, after which a given dataID will not be announced in\
   the bundle header unless a new Mode 1 message has been sent.  If the\
   sender has more dataIDs sent (and not timed out) than will fit in the\
   bundle header, the DSNs MUST be announced on a round-robin basis,\
   with the exception that no bundle header will announce a DSN for a\
   Mode 1 message contained within that bundle.  If a duplicate DSN is\
   received, it may be silently discarded.\
\
4.3.  Congestion Control\
\
   The congestion control mechanism operates as described in [7].\
\
4.4.  Any-Source Multicast\
\
   SRMP uses the Any-Source Multicast Mode.  Each sender will determine\
   its maximum RTT, suppression data rate, and sending rate with respect\
   to each sender.  Each receiver will measure its RTT and desired rate\
   to each sender in the group, and send feedback to every sender by\
   sending to the multicast group.\
\
4.5.  Multiple Sources\
\
   Under SRMP, each group member in a multicast group is a sender as\
   well as a receiver.  Each receiver may need to participate in TFMCC\
   information exchange with all senders.  Thus, when a receiver sends a\
\
\
\
\
Pullen, et al.                Experimental                     [Page 14]\
\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   feedback message, it must identify to which source the message should\
   be sent using the "Sender ID" field in the header.\
\
   The feedback is multicast to the group.  Depending on the network\
   situation, senders may select different receivers to provide\
   feedback.  Feedback messages from receivers that are not among those\
   selected by the local TFMCC to provide feedback should be silently\
   discarded.\
\
4.6.  Bundle Size\
\
   TFMCC is designed for traffic with a fixed message size.  The maximum\
   bundle size (including header) for SRMP is set to a configurable\
   maximum, typically 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU minus IP and UDP header\
   lengths).  The bundle size will be used in a TCP throughput equation,\
   to get a desired source rate.  However, in SRMP, the message size is\
   variable because:\
\
   1. After bundle time out, the current bundle will not wait for new\
      SRMP messages.  This happens with sources sending at a slow rate.\
\
   2. In long messages, there is no further space in the current bundle\
      for new SRMP messages.  This will happen with sources sending at a\
      high rate or sending messages with a length over half of the\
      bundle payload size.\
\
   The case 1 bundle size is likely to be much smaller than that of case\
   2.\
\
   Therefore, in SRMP, the mean value of the 10 most recent bundles'\
   sizes will be used as the bundle size in the TCP throughput equation.\
   This mean value is independent from the network condition and\
   reflects current activity of the source.\
\
4.7.  Data Rate Control\
\
   Each host will have a single instance of SRMP supporting all of its\
   applications.  Thus, the sender's source rate is the sum of the rates\
   of all the clients of the same multicast group.\
\
   If the source rate is larger than the sender's desired transmission\
   rate, it is the sender's responsibility to do traffic shaping.  Any\
   method that conforms to the target sending rate may be used.  The\
   RECOMMENDED method is to randomly discard enough Mode 0 messages to\
   meet the target rate.\

\
\
4.8.  Mode 1 Loss Detection\
\
   Bundle header processing includes checking each DSN in the bundle\
   header and scheduling a NACK for each DSN bearing a dataID for which\
   some application has indicated interest, if the SN/SegNo in that DSN\
   indicates that a NACK is needed.  NACKs are sent in bundles and may\
   be bundled with data messages.  A NACK is required if:\
\
   o  the SN is one or more greater (mod 512) than the latest received\
      Mode 1 message for that dataID, or\
\
   o  the SegNo has not been received, some segment of the <dataID,SN>\
      has been received, and a user-defined Segment_Timeout, which SHALL\
      NOT be less than 50 ms, has expired since receipt of the first\
      SegNo for the <dataID,SN>.\
\
   The bundling sublayer will pass the DSN list in any received bundle\
   header to the SRT sublayer.  It also will suppress NACKs in outgoing\
   bundles, as described in the next section.\
\
4.8.1.  Sending a Negative Acknowledgement\
\
   Negative acknowledgements are used by SRMP for multicast messages in\
   order to avoid the congestion of an "ACK implosion" at the original\
   sender that would likely occur if positive acknowledgements were used\
   instead.  However, with a large multicast group spread out over a\
   congested wide-area network, there is the potential for enough\
   members of the multicast group to fail to receive the message and\
   generate NACKs to cause considerable congestion at the original\
   sender despite the use of negative acknowledgements instead of\
   positive acknowledgements.  For this reason, SRMP uses a NACK\
   suppression mechanism to reduce the number of NACKs generated in\
   response to any single lost message.\
\
   The NACK suppression mechanism uses the Bundle_Timeout to distribute\
   NACKs over an appropriate time window.  This assumes that the user\
   has selected a bundle timeout appropriate for the needs of the\
   application for real-time responsiveness.\
\
   When the bundling sublayer is ready to send a bundle, it removes from\
   the bundle any NACKs for which a response has been sent by another\
   member of the multicast group within the NACK_Repeat_Timeout window.\
   If the original Bundle_Timeout has not expired, transmission of the\
   bundle may then be delayed until the original Bundle_Timeout expires\
   or the bundle is full, whichever happens first.\

\
\
4.9.  Unbundling\
\
   After a receiver completes congestion control processing on a bundle,\
   it parses the bundle into SRT messages and sends these to the SRT\
   sublayer.\
\
4.10.  Heartbeat Bundle\
\
   SRMP implementations may support a user-defined Heartbeat_Interval,\
   which SHALL NOT be less than one second.  At the end of each\
   heartbeat interval, if the sender has not sent any bundle, an empty\
   bundle will be sent in order to trigger Mode 1 loss detection.\
\
5.  SRT Operation\
\
   SRMP operates in three distinct transmission modes in order to\
   deliver varying levels of reliability: Mode 0 for multicast data that\
   does not require reliable transmission, Mode 1 for data that must be\
   received reliably by all members of a multicast group, and Mode 2 for\
   data that must be received reliably by a single dynamically\
   determined member of a multicast group.\
\
   Mode 0 operates as a pure best-effort service.  Mode 1 operates with\
   negative acknowledgements only, triggered by bundle arrivals that\
   indicate loss of a Mode 1 message.  Mode 2 uses a positive\
   acknowledgement for each message to provide reliability and low\
   latency.  Mode 2 is used where a transaction between two members of a\
   multicast group is needed.  Because there can be many members in such\
   a group, use of a transaction protocol, with reliability achieved by\
   SRMP retransmission, avoids the potentially large amount of\
   connection setup and associated state that would be required if each\
   pair of hosts in the group established a separate TCP connection.\
\
   Use of SRMP anticipates that only a small fraction of messages will\
   require reliable multicast, and a comparably small fraction will\
   require reliable unicast.  This is due to a property of distributed\
   virtual simulation: the preponderance of messages consist of state\
   update streams for object attributes such as position and\
   orientation.  SRMP is unlikely to provide effective reliable\
   multicast if the traffic does not have this property.\
\
   In SRMP, "dataID" is used to associate related messages with each\
   other.  Typically, all messages with the same dataID are associated\
   with the same application entity.  All the messages with the same\
   dataID must be transmitted in the same mode.  Among all the messages\
   with the same dataID, the latest version  will obsolete all older\
   messages.\

RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
5.1.  Mode 0 Operation\
\
   Mode 0 is for multicast messages that do not require reliable\
   transmission because they are part of a real-time stream of data that\
   is periodically updated with high frequency.  Any such message is\
   very likely to have been superceded by a more recent update before\
   retransmission could be completed.\
\
5.1.1.  Sending Mode 0 Messages\
\
   When an application requests transmission of Mode 0 data, a\
   destination multicast group must be provided to SRMP along with the\
   data to be sent.  After verifying the data length and multicast\
   group, the following steps MUST be performed by the SRT sublayer:\
\
   1. An SRT message MUST be generated with the following\
      characteristics:\
\
      the version is set to the current version, the message type is set\
      to 0x0, the mode is set to 0x0.  User data is included after the\
      message header.  If the message cannot be generated as described\
      above, the user data is discarded and the error MUST be reported\
      to the application.\
\
   2. If step 1 was completed without error, the newly generated message\
      MUST be sent to the bundling sublayer.  The implementation MUST\
      report to the application whether the message was ultimately\
      accepted by UDP.\
\
5.1.2.  Receiving Mode 0 Messages\
\
   When a Mode 0 message is received by SRMP, it MUST be processed as\
   follows: after verifying the version, message type, and destination\
   multicast address fields, the user data MUST be delivered to all\
   applications that are associated with the multicast group in the\
   message.  If the SRMP receiver has never received any Mode 1 messages\
   before the Mode 0 message is received, the Mode 0 message should be\
   silently discarded.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that the following information be provided to the\
   receiving applications: message body, multicast address.\
\
5.2.  Mode 1 Operation\
\
   Mode 1 is for multicast data that requires reliable transmission.  A\
   Mode 1 message can be either a data message or a NACK.  Mode 1 data\
   messages are expected to be part of a data stream.  This data stream\
   is likely to contain Mode 0 messages as well (see section 5.1.1), but\
\
\
\
Pullen, et al.                Experimental                     [Page 18]\
\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   it is possible for a data stream to be comprised solely of Mode 1\
   messages.\
\
5.2.1.  Sending Mode 1 Data Messages\
\
   After the data length, dataID, and destination multicast group are\
   verified, SRT MUST take the following steps:\
\
   1. If the message will not fit in an empty bundle with DSN_Max DSN in\
      the header, the message MUST be segmented.  The remaining steps\
      pertain to each segment of the message.  Each segment receives a\
      unique SegNo, starting with 0 and ending with (NoSegs-1).\
\
   2. An SRT message is generated with the following characteristics:\
      the version is set to 0x02, the message type is set to 0x0, the\
      transmission mode is set to 0x01, the SN is set equal to the SN of\
      the most recently sent Mode 1 complete message of the same dataID,\
      incremented by 1 modulo 512.  If no such Mode 1 message exists,\
      the SN is set to 0x0.\
\
   3. The newly generated message (all segments) must then be buffered,\
      replacing any formerly buffered Mode 1 message of the same dataID,\
      destination multicast address.  If the message cannot be buffered,\
      the user data is discarded and the error is reported to the\
      application.\
\
   4. If step 2 was completed without error, the newly generated message\
      is sent to the TFMCC sublayer.\
\
5.2.2.  Receiving Mode 1 Data Messages\
\
   When a Mode 1 data message is received by SRT, it will be processed\
   as follows (assuming that the version field has already been verified\
   to be 0x02):\
\
   1. The destination address MUST be verified to be a valid IP\
      multicast address on which this instance of SRMP is a member.  If\
      this is not the case, the message should be silently discarded.\
\
   2. The destination address MUST be verified to be one for which some\
      application has indicated interest.  Otherwise, the message should\
      be silently discarded.\
\
   3. The SN, SegNo, source_ip_address, and the body of the received\
      message MUST be buffered, and the user data MUST then be delivered\
      to all applications that have indicated interest in the multicast\
      group of the received message.\
\

\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   4. When a new DSN value is received with NoSegs greater than zero, a\
      timer should be set for Segment_Timeout, after which a NACK should\
      be sent to the bundling sublayer and the timer should be restarted\
      for Segment_Timeout.\
\
   5. If NoSegs in the received message is not 0, a reassembly process\
      MUST be started.  Each segment MUST be buffered.  If receipt of\
      the current message completes the segment, the reassembled message\
      MUST be released to the application and the Segment_Timeout timer\
      cancelled.\
\
   6. If a new DSN is received before all segments of the previous DSN\
      are received, the segments that have been received should be\
      dropped silently.\
\
   7. It is RECOMMENDED that the following information be provided to\
      the receiving applications: message body, dataID,\
      source_ip_address, multicast_group address.\
\
   8. When a client signs on to a new multicast group, all locally\
      buffered Mode 1 messages related to that multicast group should be\
      delivered to the client immediately.\
\
5.2.3.  Sending a Negative Acknowledgement\
\
   Whenever a bundle is received, the bundling sublayer will forward the\
   DSN list from the bundle header to the SRT sublayer.  The SRT\
   sublayer will examine buffered values of <SenderID,dataID,SN,SegNo>\
   to determine whether a NACK is required.  If so, it will generate a\
   NACK message and send it to the bundling sublayer.  The NACK message\
   will have version set to 0x2, message type set to 0x2, and\
   transmission mode set to 0x7.  dataID, SN, and destination address\
   are set to that of the Mode 1 message for which the NACK is being\
   sent.  If a NACK has been received from any member of the destination\
   multicast group for the Mode 1 message in question within the NACK\
   threshold, no NACK is generated.\
\
   For segmented messages, there are two possible types of NACKs:\
\
   o  Based on the DSN list in the bundle header, the SRT implementation\
      may determine that an entire segmented Mode 1 message was lost.\
      In this case, the NACK MUST carry SegNo=0x7F (all in one field).\
\
   o  Based on the Segment Timeout, the SRT implementation may determine\
      that one or more segments of a message have not been delivered.\
      In this case, a NACK will be sent for each missing segment.\
\

RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
5.2.4.  Receiving a Negative Acknowledgement\
\
   When a NACK is received by SRT, it MUST be processed as follows,\
   after verifying the multicast address, dataID, source IP address, and\
   transmission mode:\
\
   1. If this instance of SRT's most recent Mode 1 message of the dataID\
      indicated in the NACK has an SN newer than the SN in the NACK,\
      that message (which is buffered) should be immediately\
      retransmitted to the multicast address indicated in the received\
      NACK.  If the most recent Mode 1 message has an SN equal to the SN\
      indicated in the NACK, and if the SegNo field in the NACK contains\
      0x7F, all segments of the buffered Mode 1 message MUST be\
      retransmitted; if the SegNo has some other value, only the\
      indicated segment should be retransmitted.\
\
   2. Whether or not step 1 results in the retransmission of a message,\
      the event of receiving the NACK and the (local machine) time at\
      which the NACK was received should be buffered.  Each instance of\
      SRT MUST buffer the number of NACKs that have been received for\
      each dataID-multicast address pair, since the most recent Mode 1\
      message of the same pair was received and the time at which the\
      most recent of these NACKs was received.\
\
5.3.  Mode 2 Operation\
\
   Mode 2 is for infrequent reliable transaction-oriented communication\
   between two dynamically determined members of a multicast group.  TCP\
   could be used for such communication, but there would be unnecessary\
   overhead and delay in establishing a stream-oriented connection for a\
   single exchange of data, whereas there is already an ongoing stream\
   of best-effort data between the hosts that require Mode 2\
   transmission.  An example is a Distributed Interactive Simulation\
   (DIS) collision PDU.\
\
5.3.1.  Sending Mode 2 Data Messages\
\
   When an application requests transmission of Mode 2 data, a dataID\
   and a destination unicast IP address MUST be provided to SRT along\
   with the data to be sent.  After verifying the data length, dataID,\
   and destination address, SRT MUST perform the following steps:\
\
   1. An SRT message is generated with the following characteristics:\
      the version is set to 0x02, the message type is set to 0x02, the\
      transmission mode is set to 0x2, the dataID is set to the\
      application-provided value, and the destination address is set to\
      the application-provided IP address.  The SN is set equal to the\
      SN of the most recently sent Mode 2 message of the same dataID\

\
\
      incremented by 1 modulo 65536.  If no such Mode 1 message exists,\
      it is set to 0x0.\
\
   2. The newly generated message is buffered.  This new message does\
      not replace any formerly buffered Mode 2 messages.  An\
      implementation MUST provide a Mode 2 message buffer that can hold\
      one or more Mode 2 messages. Mode 2 messages are expected to be\
      infrequent (less than 1 percent of total traffic), but it is still\
      strongly RECOMMENDED that an implementation provide a buffer of\
      user-configurable size Mode2_Max that can hold more than a single\
      Mode 2 message.  If the message cannot be buffered, the user data\
      is discarded and the error MUST be reported to the application.\
      If the message can be buffered, it should be sent to UDP\
      immediately after being buffered.\
\
   3. If step 2 was completed without error, the newly generated message\
      MUST be sent to the IP address contained in its destination\
      address field, encapsulated within a UDP datagram.  If the UDP\
      interface on the sending system reports an error to SRT when the\
      attempt to send the SRT message is made, an implementation may\
      attempt to resend the message any finite number of times.\
      However, every implementation MUST provide a mode in which no\
      retries are attempted.  Implementations should default to this\
      latter mode of operation.  The implementation MUST report to the\
      application whether the message was ultimately accepted by UDP.\
\
   4. If some user-configurable "ACK_Threshold" (which should be greater\
      than the worst-case round-trip time for the multicast group)\
      elapses without receipt of an ACK for the Mode 2 message, it is\
      retransmitted.  An implementation may define a maximum number of\
      retransmissions to be attempted before the Mode 2 message is\
      removed from the buffer.\
\
5.3.2.  Receiving Mode 2 Data Messages\
\
   When a Mode 2 data message is received by SRT, it should be processed\
   as follows after verifying version, dataID, sender address, and SN:\
\
   1. For Mode 2 messages, the sequence number field is used to\
      associate the required positive acknowledgement with a specific\
      Mode 2 message.  If the message passes verification, the\
      encapsulated user data is delivered to all applications that have\
      indicated interest in the dataID and multicast address of the\
      received message, regardless of the value of the SN field.\
\
   2. Additionally, an ACK MUST be sent to the host from which the Mode\
      2 data message originated.  See section 5.3.3. below for details.\

RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
5.3.3.  Sending a Positive Acknowledgement\
\
   A positive acknowledgement (ACK) is triggered by the receipt of a\
   Mode 2 data message.  To send an ACK, a new SRT message is generated\
   with version set to 0x02, message type set to 0x2, and transmission\
   mode set to 0x2.  The dataID and SN are those of the Mode 2 data\
   message being acknowledged.  The destination address field is set to\
   the source IP address from which the data message was received.\
   Since Mode 2 data messages are unicast, there is little concern about\
   an ACK implosion causing excessive congestion at the original sender,\
   so no suppression mechanism is necessary.\
\
5.3.4.  Receiving a Positive Acknowledgement\
\
   When an ACK is received by SRT, after verifying the transmission\
   mode, dataID, and source IP address against outstanding Mode 2\
   transmission, SRT MUST remove the pending transmission from its\
   buffer.\
\
6.  RFC 2357 Analysis\
\
   This section provides answers to the questions posed by RFC 2357 for\
   reliable multicast protocols, which are quoted.\
\
6.1.  Scalability\
\
   "How scalable is the protocol to the number of senders or receivers\
   in a group, the number of groups, and wide dispersion of group\
   members?"\
\
   SRMP is intended to scale at least to hundreds of group members.  It\
   has been designed not to impose limitations on the scalability of the\
   underlying multicast network.  No problems have been identified in\
   its mechanisms that would preclude this on uncongested networks.\
\
   "Identify the mechanisms which limit scalability and estimate those\
   limits."\
\
   There is a practical concern with use of TFMCC, in that the receiver\
   with the most congested path constrains delivery to the entire group.\
   Distributed virtual simulation requires data delivery at rates\
   perceived as continuous by humans.  Therefore, it may prove necessary\
   to assign such receivers to different, lower-fidelity groups as a\
   practical means of sustaining performance to the majority of\
   participating hosts.  SRMP does not have a mechanism to support such\
   pruning at this time.\
\
\

RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
6.2.  Congestion\
\
   "How does the protocol protect the Internet from congestion?  How\
   well does it perform?  When does it fail?  Under what circumstances\
   will the protocol fail to perform the functions needed by the\
   applications it serves?  Is there a congestion control mechanism?\
   How well does it perform?  When does it fail?"\
\
   Both simulations and tests indicate that SRMP with TFMCC displays\
   backoff comparable to that of TCP under conditions of significant\
   packet loss.  The mechanism fails in a network-friendly way, in that\
   under severe congestion, it reduces sending of the best-effort\
   traffic to a very small rate that typically is unsatisfactory to\
   support a virtual simulation.  This is possible because the reliable\
   traffic typically is a small percentage of the overall traffic and\
   SRMP is NACK oriented, with NACK suppression, so that reliable\
   traffic loss adds little traffic to the total.  If the traffic mix\
   assumption is not met, the reliable traffic (which does not back off\
   under increased RTT) could produce a higher level of traffic than a\
   comparable TCP connection.  However, levels of reliable traffic this\
   large are not in the intended application domain of SRMP.\
\
   "Include a description of trials and/or simulations which support the\
   development of the protocol and the answers to the above questions."\
\
   SRMP has been simulated using a discrete event simulator developed\
   for academic use [8].  The design assumptions were validated by the\
   results.  It also has been emulated in a LAN-based cluster and\
   application-tested in a wide-area testbed under its intended traffic\
   mix (distributed virtual simulation) and using a traffic generator\
   with losses emulated by random dropping of packets [9].\
\
   "Include an analysis of whether the protocol has congestion avoidance\
   mechanisms strong enough to cope with deployment in the Global\
   Internet, and if not, clearly document the circumstances in which\
   congestion harm can occur.  How are these circumstances to be\
   prevented?"\
\
   Because it provides sending backoff comparable to TCP, SRMP is able\
   to function as well as TCP for congestion avoidance, even in the\
   Global Internet.  The only way an SRMP sender can generate congestion\
   is to use the protocol for unintended purposes, for example, reliable\
   transmission of a large fraction of the traffic.  Doing this would\
   produce unsatisfactory results for the application, as SRMP's\
   mechanism for providing reliability will not function well if the\
   best-effort traffic does not constitute the majority of the total\
   traffic.\

\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   "Include a description of any mechanisms which contain the traffic\
   within limited network environments."\
\
   SRMP has no such mechanisms, as it is intended for use over the open\
   Internet.\
\
   "Reliable multicast protocols must include an analysis of how they\
   address a number of security and privacy concerns."\
\
   See section 7 below.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   As a transport protocol, SRMP is subject to denial of service by\
   hostile third parties sending conflicting values of its parameters on\
   the multicast address.  SRMP could attempt to protect itself from\
   this sort of behavior.  However, it can be shielded from such attacks\
   by traffic authentication at the network layer, as described below.\
   A comparable level of authentication also could be obtained by a\
   message using MD5, or a similar message hash in each bundle, and\
   using the SRMP bundle header to detect duplicate transmissions from a\
   given host.  However, this would duplicate the function of existing\
   network layer authentication protocols.\
\
   Specific threats that can be eliminated by packet-level\
   authentication are as follows:\
\
   a. Amplification attack: SRMP receivers could be manipulated into\
      sending large amounts of NACK traffic, which could cause network\
      congestion or overwhelm the processing capabilities of a sender.\
      This could be done by sending them faked traffic indicating that a\
      reliable transmission has been lost.  SRMP's NACK suppression\
      limits the effect of such manipulation.  However, true protection\
      requires authentication of each bundle.\
\
   b. Denial-of-service attack: If an SRMP sender accepts a large number\
      of forged NACKs, it will flood the multicast group with repair\
      messages.  This attack also is stopped by per-bundle\
      authentication.\
\
   c. Replay attack: The attacker could copy a valid, authenticated\
      bundle containing a NACK and send it repeatedly to the original\
      sender of the NACKed data.  Protection against this attack\
      requires a sequence number per transmission per source host.  The\
      SRMP bundle header sequence number would satisfy this need.\
      However, the SN also can be applied at a lower layer.\
\

\
RFC 4410        Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol    February 2006\
\
\
   d. Reverse path forwarding attack (spoofing): If checks are not\
      enabled in all network routers and switches along the path from\
      each sender to all receivers, forged packets can be injected into\
      the multicast tree data path to manipulate the protocol into\
      sending a large volume of repairs.  Packet-level authentication\
      can eliminate this possibility.\
\
   e. Inadvertent errors: A receiver with an incorrect or corrupted\
      implementation of TFMCC could respond with values of RTT that\
      might stimulate a TFMCC sender to create or increase congestion in\
      the path to that sender.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that\
      receivers be required to identify themselves as legitimate before\
      they receive the Session Description needed to join the session.\
      How receivers identify themselves as legitimate is outside the\
      scope of this document.\
\
   The required authentication could become part of SRMP or could be\
   accomplished by a lower layer protocol.  In any case, it needs to be\
   (1) scalable and (2) not very computationally demanding so it can be\
   performed with minimal delay on a real-time virtual simulation\
   stream.  Public-key encryption meets the first requirement but not\
   the second.  Using the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) (RFC 4302\
   [3]) meets the second requirement using symmetric-key cryptography.\
   See RFC 4302 [3] for guidance on multicast per-packet authentication.\
   In practice, users of distributed simulation are likely to work over\
   a (possibly virtual) private network and thus will not need special\
   authentication for SRMP.\

9.  Contributions\
\
   We gratefully acknowledge the significant contributions of two\
   people without whom this RFC would not have been developed.\
   Vincent Laviano created the first specification and implementation\
   of SRMP (at that time called SRTP).  Babu Shanmugam employed SRMP\
   in a sizable distributed virtual simulation environment, where he\
   revised the implementation and helped revise the design to support\
   distributed virtual simulation workload effectively.\

Abstract\
\
   This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session\
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to be included in a BYE\
   Method Request as a result of a session preemption event, either at a\
   user agent (UA), or somewhere in the network involving a\
   reservation-based protocol such as the Resource ReSerVation Protocol\
   (RSVP) or Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS).  This document does not\
   attempt to address routers failing in the packet path; instead, it\
   addresses a deliberate tear down of a flow between UAs, and informs\
   the terminated UA(s) with an indication of what occurred.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   With the introduction of the SIP Resource-Priority (R-P) header [4],\
   there became the possibility of sessions being torn down for (scarce)\
   resource reasons, meaning there weren't enough resources for a\
   particular session to continue.  Certain domains will implement this\
   mechanism where resources may become constrained either at the user\
   agent (UA) or at congested router interfaces where more important\
   sessions are to be completed at the expense of less important\
   sessions.  Which sessions are more or less important than others will\
   not be discussed here.  What is proposed here is a SIP [2] extension\
   to synchronize SIP elements as to why a preemption event occurred and\
   which type of preemption event occurred, as viewed by the element\
   that performed the preemption of a session.\
\
   The SIP Reason Header is an application layer feedback mechanism to\
   synchronize SIP elements of events; the particular event explained\
   here deals with preemption of a session.  Q.850 [5] provides an\

RFC 4411        SIP Reason Header for Preemption Events    February 2006\
\
\
   indication for preemption (cause=8) and for preemption "circuit\
   reserved for reuse" (cause=9).  Q.850 Cause=9 does not apply to IP,\
   as IP has no concept of circuits.  Some domains wish to differentiate\
   appropriate IP reasons for preemption of sessions and to indicate\
   topologically where the preemption event occurred.  No other means\
   exists today to give feedback as to why a session was torn down on\
   preemption grounds.\
\
   In the event that a session is terminated for a specific reason that\
   can (or should) be shared with SIP Servers and UAs sharing dialog,\
   the Reason Header [1] was created to be included in the BYE Request.\
   This was not the only Method for this new Header; [1] also discusses\
   the CANCEL Method usage.\
\
   This document will define two use cases in which new preemption\
   Reason values are necessary:\
\
      Access Preemption Event - This is when a UA receives a new SIP\
            session request message with a valid R-P value that is\
            higher than the one associated with the currently active\
            session at that UA.  The UA must discontinue the existing\
            session in order to accept the new one (according to local\
            policy of some domains).\
\
      Network Preemption Event - This is when a network element - such\
            as a router - reaches capacity on a particular interface and\
            has the ability to statefully choose which session(s) will\
            remain active when a new session/reservation is signaled for\
            under the parameters outlined in SIP Preconditions per [3]\
            that would otherwise overload that interface (perhaps\
            adversely affecting all sessions).  In this case, the router\
            must terminate one or more reservations of lower priority in\
            order to allow this higher priority reservation access to\
            the requested amount of bandwidth (according to local policy\
            of some domains).\
\
   This document will cover the semantics for these two cases and\
   request IANA registration of the new protocol value "Preemption" for\
   the Reason Header field, with 4 cause values for the above preemption\
   conditions.  Additionally, this document will create a new IANA\
   Registry for reason-text strings that are not currently defined\
   through existing SIP Response codes or Q.850 cause codes.  This new\
   Registry will be useful for future protocols used by the SIP Reason\
   header.\
\
   This document will emphasize an existing SIP RFC [3] as the starting\
   point for network preemption events.  RFC 3312 set rules surrounding\
   SIP interaction using a reservation protocol for QoS preconditions,\

\
\
   using RSVP as the example protocol.  That effort did not preclude\
   other preconditions or future protocol work from becoming a means of\
   preconditions.  NSIS is a new reservation protocol effort that\
   specifies a preemption operation similar to RSVP's ResvErr message\
   involving the NSIS NOTIFY message in [8] with a Transient error code\
   0x04000005 (Resources Pre-empted).\
\
   Note that SIP itself does not cause RSVP or NSIS reservation\
   signaling to start or end.  That operation is part of a separate API\
   within each UA.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [6].\
\
2.  Access Preemption Events\
\
   As mentioned previously, Access Preemption Events (APE) occur at the\
   user agent.  It does not matter which UA in a unicast or multicast\
   session this happens to (the UAC or UAS of a session).  If local\
   policy dictates in a particular domain rules regarding the\
   functionality of a UA, there must be a means by which that UA (not\
   the user) informs the other UA(s) why a session was just torn down\
   prematurely.  The appropriate mechanism is the BYE Method.  The user\
   of the other far side UA will not understand why that session "just\
   went away" without there being a means of informing the UA of what\
   occurred (if this event was purposeful).  Through this type of\
   indication to the preempted UA, it can indicate to the user of that\
   device appropriately.\
\
   The rules within a domain surrounding the UA to be informed can be\
   different from the rules for informing the user.  Local policy should\
   determine if the user should be informed of the specific reason.\
   This indication in SIP will provide a means for the UA to react in a\
   locally determined way, if appropriate (play a certain tone or tone\
   sequence, point towards a special announcement uri, cause the UA's\
   visual display to do something, etc.).\
\
   Figure 1 illustrates the scenario.  UA1 invites UA2 to a session with\
   the Resource Priority level of 3 (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this\
   domain, and the namespace element is not necessary for this\
   discussion).\

          Figure 1. Access Preemption with obscure Reason\
\
   After the session between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA2\
   to a new session with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the current\
   session between UA1 and UA2).  Local policy within this domain\
   dictates that UA2 must preempt all existing calls of lower priority\
   in order to accept a higher priority call.\
\
   What Reason value could be inserted above to mean "preemption" at a\
   UA?  There are several choices: 410 "Gone", 480 "Temporarily\
   Unavailable", 486 "Busy Here", and 503 "Service Unavailable".  The\
   use of any of these here is questionable because the session is\
   already established.  It is further complicated if there needs to be\
   a difference in the Reason value for an Access versus a Network\
   Preemption Event (which is a requirement here).  The limits of Q.850\
   [5] have been stated previously in this document.\
\
   It should be possible to configure UAs receiving a preemption\
   indication to indicate to the user that no particular type of\
   preemption occurred.  There are some domains that might prefer their\
   users to remain unaware of the specifics of network behavior.  This\
   should not ever prevent a known preemption indication from being sent\
   in a BYE from a UA.\

RFC 4411        SIP Reason Header for Preemption Events    February 2006\
\
\
2.1.  Effects of Preemption at the User Agent\
\
   If 2 UAs are in a session and one UA must preempt that session to\
   accept another session, a BYE Method message is the appropriate\
   mechanism to perform this task.  However, taking this a step further,\
   if a UA is the common point of a 3-way (or more) ad hoc conference\
   and must preempt all sessions in that conference due to receipt of a\
   higher-priority session request (that this UA must accept), then a\
   BYE message must be sent to all UAs in that ad hoc conference.\
\
2.2.  Reason Header Requirements for Access Preemption Events\
\
   The following is a list of requirements for adding an appropriate\
   Reason value for an Access Preemption Event (APE) as described above\
   and shown in Figure 1:\
\
      APE_REQ#1 - create a means by which one UA can inform another UA\
                  (within the same active session) that the active\
                  session between the two devices is being purposely\
                  preempted at one UA for a higher-priority session\
                  request from another UA.\
\
      APE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can\
                  be informed of this Access Preemption Event to a\
                  specific session.\
\
   For example: perhaps SIP Servers that have incorporated a Record-\
   Route header into that session set up need to be informed of this\
   occurrence.\
\
      APE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in an ad\
                  hoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has\
                  preempted the conference by accepting a higher-\
                  priority session request.\
\
      APE_REQ#4 - create a separate indication for the access preemption\
                  event than the one used for a Network Preemption Event\
                  (described in the next section) in the session BYE\
                  message.\
\
      APE_REQ#5 - create a means to generate a specific indication of a\
                  preemption event at the user agent to inform all\
                  relevant SIP entities, yet have the ability to\
                  generalize this indication (based on local policy) to\
                  the receiving UA such that this UA cannot display more\
                  information than the domain wants the user to see.\

\
\
3.  Network Preemption Events\
\
   Network Preemption Events (NPE) are instances in which an\
   intermediate router between SIP user agents preempts one or more\
   sessions at one of its interfaces to place a higher-priority session\
   through that interface.  Within RSVP, there exists a means to execute\
   this functionality per [7]: ResvErr messages, which travel downstream\
   towards appropriate receivers.  The ResvErr message has the ability\
   to carry within it a code indicating why a reservation is being torn\
   down.  The ResvErr does not travel upstream to the other UA.  This\
   document proposes that a SIP message be generated to synchronize all\
   relevant SIP elements to this preemption event, including the\
   upstream UA.  Creating another Reason value describing that a network\
   element preempted the session is necessary in certain domains.\
\
   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate a network preemption scenario with RSVP.\
   NSIS, not shown in examples here, can be imagined from [8] with a\
   NOTIFY error message indicating that a reservation has been preempted\
   with the Transient ERROR_SPEC 0x04000005.  SIP behavior will be\
   identical using either reservation protocol.\
\
   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3\
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher in this domain) and is accepted.  This SIP\
   signaling translated the Resource Priority value to an appropriate\
   RSVP priority level for that flow.  The link between Router 1 and\
   Router 2 became saturated with this session reservation between UA1\
   and UA2 (in this example).\
\
             UA1                                  UA2\
                \\                                /\
                 \\                              /\
                  +--------+          +--------+\

                  +--------+          +--------+\
                 /                              \\\
                /                                \\\

\
                Figure 2. Network Diagram Scenario A\
\
   After the session between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA4\
   to a new session with a Resource Priority level of 2 (a higher\
   priority than the current reservation between UA1 and UA2).  Again,\
   the priority value within the Resource-Priority header of this INVITE\
   is translated into an appropriate RSVP priority (that is also higher\

RFC 4411        SIP Reason Header for Preemption Events    February 2006\
\
\
   in relative priority to the UA1_UA2 session/RSVP flow).  When this\
   second, higher-priority session is signaled, one Path message goes\
   from UA3 to UA4, resulting in the RESV message going from UA4 back to\
   UA3.  Because this link between the two routers is at capacity (at\
   Int7 in Figure 5), Router 1 will (in this example) make the decision\
   or will communicate with another network entity that will make the\
   decision to preempt lower-priority BW to ensure that this higher-\
   priority session reservation is completed.  A ResvErr message is sent\
   to UA2.  The result is that UA2 will know that there has been a\
   preemption event in a router (because the ResvErr message has a error\
   code within it, stating "preemption").  At this point, UA1 will not\
   know anything of this preemption.  If there are any SIP Proxies\
   between UAs 1 and 2 (perhaps that inserted a Record-Route Header),\
   each will also need to be informed as to why this reservation was\
   torn down.\
\
   Figure 3 shows the call flow with Router 2 from Figure 2 included at\
   the RSVP layer sending the ResvErr message.  A complete call flow\
   including all UAs and Routers is not shown here for diagram\
   complexity reasons.  The complete signaling between UA3 and UA4 is\
   also not included.\

   in reaction to a Network Preemption Event (NPE):\
\
      NPE_REQ#1 - create a means of informing the far-end UA that a\
                  Network Preemption Event has occurred in an\
                  intermediate router.\
\
      NPE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can\
                  be informed of a Network Preemption Event to a\
                  specific session.\
\
   For example: perhaps SIP Servers have incorporated a Record-Route\
   header into that session set up.\
\
      NPE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in an ad\
                  hoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has\
                  been preempted by a Network Preemption Event.\
\
      NPE_REQ#4 - create a separate description of the Network\
                  Preemption Event relative to an Access Preemption\
                  Event in SIP.\
\
4.  Including a Hybrid Infrastructure\
\
   If User 1 is in a non-IP portion of infrastructure (using a TDM\
   phone) in a session with a UA through a SIP gateway, and if the TDM\
   portion had the ability to preempt the session and indicate to the\
   SIP gateway when it did such a preemption, the SIP GW would need to\
   be able to convey this preemption event into the SIP portion of this\
   session just as if User 1 were a UA in the session.  Below is a\
   diagram of this:\

\
\
4.1.  Hybrid Infrastructure Requirements\
\
   The following are the requirements unique to the topology involving\
   both IP infrastructure and TDM (or non-IP) infrastructure.\
\
      HYB_REQ#1 - create a means of informing the far-end UA in a dialog\
                  through a SIP gateway with a non-IP phone that the TDM\
                  portion of the session indicated to the SIP gateway\
                  that a preemption event terminated the session.\
\
      HYB_REQ#2 - create a means of identifying this preemption event\
                  uniquely with respect to an access preemption and\
                  network preemption event.\
\
5.  Preemption Reason Header Cause Codes and Semantics\
\
   This document defines the following new protocol value for the\
   protocol field of the Reason header field in RFC 3326 [1]:\
\
      Preemption: The cause parameter contains a preemption cause code.\
\
   We define the following preemption cause codes:\
\
   Value    Default Text        Description\
\
     1      UA Preemption       The session has been preempted by a UA.\
\
     2      Reserved Resources  The session preemption has been\
            Preempted           initiated within the network via a\
                                purposeful RSVP preemption occurrence,\
                                and not a link error.\
\
     3      Generic Preemption  This is a limited-use preemption\
                                indication to be used on the final leg\
                                to the preempted UA to generalize the\
                                event.\
\
     4      Non-IP Preemption   The session preemption has occurred in\
                                a non-IP portion of the infrastructure,\
                                and this is the Reason cause code given\
                                by the SIP Gateway.\
\
   Example syntax for the above preemption types are as follows:\
\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA Preemption"\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=2 ;text="Reserved Resources Preempted"\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=3 ;text="Generic Preemption"\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=4 ;text="Non-IP Preemption"\

   Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 provide use cases and extended\
   definitions for the above four cause codes with message flow\
   diagrams.\
\
5.1.  Access Preemption Event Reason Code\
\
   A more elaborate description of the Access Preemption Event cause=1\
   is as follows:\
\
      A user agent in a session has purposely preempted a session and is\
      informing the far-end user agent, or user agents (if part of a\
      conference), and SIP Proxies (if stateful of the session's\
      transactions)\
\
   An example usage of this header value would be:\
\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA Preemption"\

        Figure 5. Access Preemption with Reason: UA Preemption\
\
   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3\
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher in this domain).  After the session\
   between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA2 to a new session\
   with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the current session to UA1).\
   Local policy within this domain dictates that UA2 must preempt all\
   existing calls of lower priority in order to accept a higher-priority\
   call.\
\
   UA2 sends a BYE Request message with a Reason header with a value of\
   UA Preemption.  This will inform the far-end UA (UA1) and all\
   relevant SIP elements (for example, SIP Proxies).  The cause code is\
   unique to what is proposed in the RSVP Preemption Event for\
   differentiation purposes.\

5.2.  Network Preemption Events Reason Code\
\
   A more elaborate description of the Reserved Resources Preempted\
   Event cause=2 is as follows:\
\
      A router has preempted a reservation flow and generated a\
      reservation error message: a ResvErr traveling downstream in RSVP,\
      and a NOTIFY in NSIS.  The UA receiving the preemption error\
      message generates a BYE request towards the far-side UA with a\
      Reason Header with this value indicating that somewhere between\
      two or more UAs, a router has administratively preempted this\
      session.\
\
   An example usage of this header value would be:\

RFC 4411        SIP Reason Header for Preemption Events    February 2006\
\
\
   Upon receipt of the ResvErr message with the preemption error code,\
   UA2 can now appropriately inform UA1 why this event occurred.  This\
   BYE message will also inform all relevant SIP elements, synchronizing\
   them.  The cause value is unique to that proposed in Section 4.1 for\
   Access Preemption Events for differentiation purposes.\
\
5.3.  Generic Preemption Event Reason Code\
\
   A more elaborate description of the Generic Preemption Event cause=3\
   is as follows:\
\
      This cause code is for infrastructures that do not wish to provide\
      the preempted UA with a more precise reason than just\
      "preemption".  It is possible that UAs will have code that will\
      indicate the type of preemption event that is contained in the\
      Reason header, and certain domains have expressed this as not\
      being optimal, and wanted to generalize the indication.  This MUST\
      NOT be the initial indication within these domains, as valuable\
      traffic analysis and other NM applications will be generalized as\
      well.  If this cause value is to be implemented, it SHOULD only be\
      done at the final SIP Proxy in such a way that the cause value\
      indicating which type of preemption event actually occurred is\
      changed to this generalized preemption indication to be received\
      by the preempted UA.\
\
   An example usage of this header value would be:\
\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=3 ;text="Generic Preemption"\
\
5.4.  Non-IP Preemption Event Reason Code\
\
   A more elaborate description of the Non-IP Preemption Event cause=4\
   is as follows:\
\
      A session exists in a hybrid IP/non-IP infrastructure and the\
      preemption event occurs in the non-IP portion, and was indicated\
      by that portion that this call termination was due to preemption.\
      This is the indication that would be generated by a SIP Gateway\
      towards the SIP UA that is being preempted, traversing whichever\
      SIP Proxies are involved in session signaling (a question of\
      server state).\
\
   An example usage of this header value would be:\
\
      Reason: preemption ;cause=4 ;text="Non-IP Preemption"\

\

\
   In this case, UA1 signals User3 to a session.  Once established,\
   there is a preemption event in the non-IP portion of the\
   session/call, and the TDM portion has the ability to inform the SIP\
   GW of this type of event.  This non-IP signal can be translated into\
   SIP signaling (into the BYE session termination message).  Within\
   this BYE, there should be a Reason header indicating such an event to\
   synchronize all SIP elements.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   Eavesdropping on this header field should not prevent proper\
   operation of the SIP protocol, although some domains utilizing this\
   mechanism for notifying and synchronizing SIP elements will likely\
   want the integrity to be assured.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that\
   integrity protection be applied when using this header to prevent\
   unwanted changes to the field and snooping of the messages.  The\
   accepted choices for providing integrity protection in SIP are TLS\
   and S/MIME.\

7.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document adds to one existing IANA Registry and creates one new\
   Registry.  The existing IANA Registry for the SIP Reason Header is as\
   follows:\

   --------------   --------------            ---------\

   Q.850            Cause value in decimal    ITU-T Q.850\
\
   This document adds to that Registry with the following entry\
   (including the '*' comment):\
\
   Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference\
   --------------   --------------            ---------\
   Preemption       Cause value in decimal*   RFC 4411\
\
   * See the separate "Preemption" Registry for default reason-text\
     strings.\
\
   The cause values created by the Preemption Protocol namespace in this\
   document are defined in Section 7.1.  Each cause value has a Reason-\
   text string as a general description of what the cause value is for.\
   This is shown for the existing Reason header in Section 2 of RFC\
   3326.  Before this document, the Reason-text was taken from the SIP\
   Response code string from all SIP Response codes, or the default\
   description from Q.850 cause codes.  Currently, there is no place to\
   register new reason-text strings other than from those two sources.\
   Because this document defines a new Reason header protocol namespace,\
   a new IANA Registry is created in Section 7.2 just for this and\
   future Reason header protocol namespaces (other than SIP Response\
   codes or Q.850 cause values) to register their respective general\
   descriptive text strings.  These text strings are non-binding and\
   merely the default for human understanding, but they are deemed\
   important enough to have their own Registry.\
\
7.1.  "Preemption" Namespace Registry\
\
   RFC 4411 creates the new SIP "Reason Header" [1] protocol namespace:\
   "Preemption", with 4 defined cause codes:\
\
      In instances where this namespace is used to indicate preemption\
      at a UA, the following syntax shall be used (the reason-text is a\
      default string; it is not mandatory, and may be different):\
\
         Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA Preemption"\
\
         Section 5.1 of this document describes in detail the semantics\
         of this cause code.\
\
         The default text above is part of a new IANA Registry for\
         default text strings for any new protocol namespace cause code.\
         See Section 7.2 for details.\

\
      In instances where this namespace is used to indicate preemption\
      because an RSVP ResvErr message was received at a SIP UA, the\

      In instances where this namespace is used to indicate preemption\
      from a non-IP portion of a call leg, a SIP Gateway shall use the\

      (the reason-text is a default string; it is not mandatory, and may\
      be different):\

   Additional definitions of the preemption namespace and its cause\
   codes MUST be defined in Standards Track documents.\

IESG Note\
\
   The following documents  (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408)\
   are published simultaneously as Experimental RFCs, although there is\
   no general technical consensus and efforts to reconcile the two\
   approaches have failed.  As such, these documents have not received\
   full IETF review and are published "AS-IS" to document the different\
   approaches as they were considered in the MARID working group.\
\
   The IESG takes no position about which approach is to be preferred\
   and cautions the reader that there are serious open issues for each\
   approach and concerns about using them in tandem.  The IESG believes\
   that documenting the different approaches does less harm than not\
   documenting them.\
\
   Note that the Sender ID experiment may use DNS records that may have\
   been created for the current SPF experiment or earlier versions in\
   this set of experiments.  Depending on the content of the record,\
   this may mean that Sender-ID heuristics would be applied incorrectly\
   to a message.  Depending on the actions associated by the recipient\
   with those heuristics, the message may not be delivered or may be\
   discarded on receipt.\
\
   Participants relying on Sender ID experiment DNS records are warned\
   that they may lose valid messages in this set of circumstances.\
   Participants publishing SPF experiment DNS records should consider\

\
   Participants in the Sender-ID experiment need to be aware that the\
   way Resent-* header fields are used will result in failure to receive\
   legitimate email when interacting with standards-compliant systems\
   (specifically automatic forwarders which comply with the standards by\
   not adding Resent-* headers, and systems which comply with RFC 822\
   but have not yet implemented RFC 2822 Resent-* semantics).  It would\
   be inappropriate to advance Sender-ID on the standards track without\
   resolving this interoperability problem.\
\
   The community is invited to observe the success or failure of the two\
   approaches during the two years following publication, in order that\
   a community consensus can be reached in the future.\

Abstract\
\
   Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent\
   using spoofed addresses -- "spoofed" in this case means that the\
   address is used without the permission of the domain owner.  This\
   document describes a family of tests by which SMTP servers can\
   determine whether an e-mail address in a received message was used\
   with the permission of the owner of the domain contained in that\
   e-mail address.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Today, a huge majority of unwanted e-mail contains headers that lie\
   about the origin of the mail.  This is true of most spam and\
   substantially all of the virus e-mail that is sent.\
\
   This document describes a mechanism such that receiving Mail Transfer\
   Agents (MTAs), Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs), and/or Mail User Agents\
   (MUAs) can recognize mail in the above category and take appropriate\
   action.  For example, an MTA might refuse to accept a message, an MDA\

\
\
   might discard a message rather than placing it into a mailbox, and an\
   MUA might render that message in some distinctive fashion.\
\
   In order to avoid further fragmentation of the Internet e-mail\
   system, it is desirable that the Internet community as a whole come\
   to a consensus as to what mail senders should do to make their mail\
   appear non-spoofed, and how mail receivers should determine whether\
   mail is spoofed.  On the other hand, it is not necessary to reach a\
   consensus regarding the actions that various parties take once a\
   message has been determined to be spoofed.  This can be done\
   unilaterally -- one agent might decide to discard a spoofed message\
   whereas another decides to add a disclaimer.\
\
   This document defines a pair of closely-related tests.  One validates\
   a message's Purported Responsible Address (PRA) as defined in\
   [RFC4407].  The other validates a message's Reverse-Path (also known\
   as MAIL-FROM address) as defined in [RFC4408].\
\
   An e-mail sender complying with this specification SHOULD publish\
   information for both tests, and SHOULD arrange that any mail that is\
   sent will pass both tests.  An e-mail receiver complying with this\
   specification SHOULD perform at least one of these tests.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",\
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",\
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Problem Statement\
\
   Briefly stated, the mechanisms of this document allow one to answer\
   the following question:\
\
      When a message is transferred via SMTP between two unrelated\
      parties, does the SMTP client host have permission to send mail on\
      behalf of a mailbox referenced by the message?\
\
   As seen from the question, this mechanism applies to unrelated\
   parties:  It is useful at the point where a message passes across the\
   Internet from one organization to another.  It is beyond the scope of\
   this document to describe authentication mechanisms that can be\
   deployed within an organization.\
\
   The PRA version of the test seeks to authenticate the mailbox\
   associated with the most recent introduction of a message into the\
   mail delivery system.  In simple cases, this is who the mail is from.\
   However, in the case of a third-party mailer, a forwarder, or a\
\
\
\
Lyon & Wong                   Experimental                      [Page 4]\
\
RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   mailing list server, the address being authenticated is that of the\
   third party, the forwarder, or the mailing list.\
\
   On the other hand, the MAIL-FROM version of the test seeks to\
   authenticate the mailbox that would receive Delivery Status\
   Notifications (DSNs, or bounces) for the message.  In simple cases,\
   this too is who the mail is from.  However, third-party mailers,\
   forwarders, and mailing list servers MUST specify an address under\
   their control, and SHOULD arrange that DSNs received at this address\
   are forwarded to the original bounce address.\
\
   In both cases, the domain associated with an e-mail address is what\
   is authenticated; no attempt is made to authenticate the local-part.\
   A domain owner gets to determine which SMTP clients speak on behalf\
   of addresses within the domain; a responsible domain owner should not\
   authorize SMTP clients that will lie about local parts.\
\
   In the long run, once the domain of the sender is authenticated, it\
   will be possible to use that domain as part of a mechanism to\
   determine the likelihood that a given message is spam, using, for\
   example, reputation and accreditation services. (These services are\
   not the subject of the present mechanism, but it should enable them.)\
\
3.  SPF 2.0 Records\
\
   Domains declare which hosts are and are not authorized to transmit\
   e-mail messages on their behalf by publishing Sender Policy Framework\
   (SPF) records in the Domain Name System.  [RFC4408] defines a format\
   for these records identified by the version prefix "v=spf1".  This\
   section defines an amended format, identified by the version prefix\
   "spf2.0", that allows sending domains to explicitly specify how their\
   records should be interpreted, and provides for additional\
   extensibility.  Sending domains MAY publish either or both formats.\
\
   Since the two formats are identical in most respects, the following\
   subsections define the "spf2.0" format relative to [RFC4408].\
\
3.1.  Version and Scope\
\
   Under Sender ID, receiving domains may perform a check of either the\
   PRA identity or the MAIL-FROM identity.  Sending domains therefore\
   require a method for declaring whether their published list of\
   authorized outbound e-mail servers can be used for the PRA check, the\
   MAIL-FROM check, or both.\
\
   This section replaces the definition of the version identifier in\
   Section 4.5 of [RFC4408] and adds the concept of SPF record scopes.\

RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   SPF records begin with a version identifier and may also include a\
   scope:\
\
      record      = version terms *SP\
      version     = "v=spf1" | ( "spf2." ver-minor scope)\
      ver-minor   = 1*DIGIT\
      scope       = "/" scope-id *( "," scope-id )\
      scope-id    = "mfrom" / "pra" / name\
\
   For example, the SPF record\
\
          spf2.0/mfrom,pra +mx +ip4:192.168.0.100 -all\
\
   defines an SPF record that can be used for either MAIL FROM or PRA\
   checks.\
\
   This document only defines the existence of two scopes: "mfrom" and\
   "pra".  The details of these two scopes are defined in other\
   documents: "mfrom" is defined in [RFC4408]; "pra" is defined in\
   [RFC4407].\
\
   Other scopes may be defined by future documents only.  There is no\
   registry for scopes.  A scope definition must define what it\
   identifies as the sending mailbox for a message, how to extract that\
   information from a message, how to determine the initial arguments\
   for the check_host() function, and what the compliant responses to\
   the result are.  This ensures that domains with published records and\
   mail receiver agree on the semantics of the scope.\
\
   A compliant domain SHOULD publish authorizations for every defined\
   scope.\
\
3.1.1.  Minor Version\
\
   All published records that use the "spf2" version identifier MUST\
   start with "spf2.0".  This document only specifies records with a\
   minor version of "0".\
\
   Future versions of this document may define other minor versions to\
   be used.\
\
3.2.  Multiple Records\
\
   A domain MAY publish multiple SPF 2.0 records, provided that each\
   scope appears in at most one SPF 2.0 record.  In addition, a domain\
   MAY also publish an SPF record that uses the "v=spf1" version\
   identifier defined in [RFC4408].  The selection rules in Section 4.4\
   define the precedence of these records.\

\
\
3.3.  Positional Modifiers\
\
   This section replaces Section 4.6.3 of [RFC4408] and adds the concept\
   of positional modifiers.\
\
   Modifiers are key/value pairs that affect the evaluation of the\
   check_host() function.\
\
   Modifiers are either global or positional:\
\
      Global modifiers MAY appear anywhere in the record, but SHOULD\
      appear at the end, after all mechanisms and positional modifiers.\
\
      Positional modifiers apply only to the mechanism they follow.  It\
      is a syntax error for a positional modifier to appear before the\
      first mechanism.\
\
   Modifiers of either type are also either singular or multiple:\
\
      Singular modifiers may appear only once in the record if they are\
      global, or once after each mechanism if they are positional.\
\
      Multiple modifiers may appear multiple times in the record if they\
      are global, or multiple times after each mechanism if they are\
      positional.\
\
   A modifier is not allowed to be defined as both global and\
   positional.\
\
   The modifiers "redirect" and "exp" described in Section 6 of\
   [RFC4408] are global and singular.\
\
   Ordering of modifiers does not matter, except that:\
\
   1. positional modifiers must appear after the mechanism they affect\
      and before any subsequent mechanisms; and\
\
   2. when a multiple modifier appears more than one time, the ordering\
      of the appearances may be significant to the modifier.\
\
   Other than these constraints, implementations MUST treat different\
   orders of modifiers the same.  An intended side effect of these rules\
   is that modifiers cannot be defined that modify other modifiers.\
\
   These rules allow an implementation to correctly pre-parse a record.\
   Furthermore, they are crafted to allow the parsing algorithm to be\
   stable, even when new modifiers are introduced.\
\

\
RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   Modifiers that are unrecognized MUST be ignored.  This allows older\
   implementations to handle records with modifiers that were defined\
   after they were written.\
\
3.4.  Compatibility\
\
   Domain administrators complying with this specification are required\
   to publish information in DNS regarding their authorized outbound\
   e-mail servers.  [RFC4408] describes a format for this information\
   identified by the version prefix "v=spf1".  Many domains have\
   published information in DNS using this format.  In order to provide\
   compatibility for these domains, Sender ID implementations SHOULD\
   interpret the version prefix "v=spf1" as equivalent to\
   "spf2.0/mfrom,pra", provided no record starting with "spf2.0" exists.\
\
   Administrators who have already published "v=spf1" records SHOULD\
   review these records to determine whether they are also valid for use\
   with PRA checks.  If the information in a "v=spf1" record is not\
   correct for a PRA check, administrators SHOULD publish either an\
   "spf2.0/pra" record with correct information or an "spf2.0/pra ?all"\
   record indicating that the result of a PRA check is explicitly\
   inconclusive.\
\
4.  Decision Model\
\
   Sender ID enables receiving e-mail systems to answer the following\
   question:\
\
   Given an e-mail message, and given an IP address from which it has\
   been (or will be) received, is the SMTP client at that IP address\
   authorized to send that e-mail message?\
\
   This question will usually be asked by an SMTP server as part of\
   deciding whether to accept an incoming mail message.  However, this\
   question could also be asked later by a different party.  An MUA, for\
   example, could use the result of this question to determine how to\
   file or present a message.\
\
   There are three steps to answering this question:\
\
   1. From an e-mail message, extract the address to verify.  The PRA\
      variant of this test does so as specified in [RFC4407], or\
      alternatively, using the submitter address as specified in\
      [RFC4405].  The MAIL FROM variant of this test does so as\
      specified in [RFC4408].\
\
   2. Extract the domain part of the address determined in step 1.\
\

RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   3. Call the check_host() function defined in [RFC4408] and modified\
      by the following subsections.\
\
   If the Sender ID check is being performed by an MTA as part of\
   receiving an e-mail message, and it cannot determine an address in\
   step 1 above (because the message or address is malformed), then the\
   message SHOULD be rejected with error "550 5.7.1 Missing Purported\
   Responsible Address" or error "550 5.7.1 Missing Reverse-Path\
   address".\
\
4.1.  Arguments\
\
   Sender ID modifies the check_host() function by the addition of a\
   scope parameter.  Thus, for Sender ID the check_host() function is\
   called passing the following parameters:\
\
      a. A scope of "pra" (for the PRA variant of the test), or "mfrom"\
         (for the MAIL FROM variant of the test).\
      b. The IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) from which the message is\
         being or has been received.\
      c. The domain from step 2 above.\
      d. The address from step 1 above.\
\
4.2.  Results\
\
   The result of the check_host() function is one of the values\
   "Neutral", "Pass", "Fail", "SoftFail", "None", "TempError", or\
   "PermError".  Section 5 describes how these results are used by MTAs\
   receiving messages.  This specification imposes no requirements on\
   parties performing this test in other environments.\
\
4.3.  Record Lookup\
\
   SPF records are looked up in DNS in accordance with Section 4.4 of\
   [RFC4408].\
\
   When performing the PRA version of the test, if the DNS query returns\
   "non-existent domain" (RCODE 3), then check_host() exits immediately\
   with the result "Fail".\
\
4.4.  Record Selection\
\
   This section replaces the record selection steps described in Section\
   4.5 of [RFC4408].\
\
   Starting with the set of records that were returned by the lookup,\
   record selection proceeds in these steps:\
\
\
\
\
Lyon & Wong                   Experimental                      [Page 9]\
\
RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   1. If any records of type SPF are in the set, then all records of\
      type TXT are discarded.\
\
   2. Records that do not begin with proper version and scope sections\
      are discarded.  The version section for "spf2" records contains a\
      ver-minor field that is for backward-compatible future extensions.\
      This field must be well formed for a record to be retained, but is\
      otherwise ignored.\
\
   3. Records that use the "spf2" version identifier and do not have a\
      scope-id that matches <scope> are discarded.  Note that this is a\
      complete string match on the scope-id tokens: If <scope> is "pra",\
      then the record starting "spf2.0/mfrom,prattle,fubar" would be\
      discarded, but a record starting "spf2.0/mfrom,pra,fubar" would be\
      retained.\
\
   4. If the lookup returned two records, one containing the "v=spf1"\
      version identifier and the other containing the "spf2" version\
      identifier, the "spf2" version takes precedence for the desired\
      scope-id.  If the "spf2" record does not contain the desired\
      scope-id, then the "v=spf1" record is selected.\
\
   5. If an "spf2" record does not contain the desired scope-id and\
      there is no "v=spf1" record for the domain, then no record is\
      selected.\
\
   After the above steps, there should be one record remaining and\
   evaluation can proceed.  If there are two or more records remaining,\
   then check_host() exits immediately with the error "PermError".\
\
   If there are no matching records remaining after the initial DNS\
   query or any subsequent optional DNS queries, then check_host() exits\
   immediately with the result "None".\
\
5.  Actions Based on the Decision\
\
   When the Sender ID test is used by an SMTP server as part of\
   receiving a message, the server should take the actions described by\
   this section.\
\
   The check_host() function returns one of the following results.  See\
   [RFC4408] for the meaning of these results.\

RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
5.1.  Neutral, None, SoftFail, or PermError\
\
   An SMTP server receiving one of these results SHOULD NOT reject the\
   message for this reason alone, but MAY subject the message to\
   heightened scrutiny by other measures, and MAY reject the message as\
   a result of this heightened scrutiny.\
\
   Such additional security measures MAY take into account that a\
   message for which the result is "SoftFail" is less likely to be\
   authentic than a message for which the result is "Neutral".\
\
5.2.  Pass\
\
   An SMTP server receiving this result SHOULD treat the message as\
   authentic.  It may accept or reject the message depending on other\
   policies.\
\
5.3.  Fail\
\
   When performing the Sender ID test during an SMTP transaction, an MTA\
   that chooses to reject a message receiving this result SHOULD reject\
   the message with a "550 5.7.1 Sender ID (xxx) yyy - zzz" SMTP error,\
   where "xxx" is replaced with "PRA" or "MAIL FROM", "yyy" is replaced\
   with the additional reason returned by the check_host() function, and\
   "zzz" is replaced with the explanation string returned by the\
   check_host() function.\
\
   When performing the Sender ID test after accepting an e-mail message\
   for delivery, an MTA that chooses to reject a message receiving this\
   result SHOULD NOT deliver the message.  Instead, it should create a\
   DSN message, consistent with the usual rules for DSN messages.\
\
5.4.  TempError\
\
   An SMTP server receiving this result MAY reject the message with a\
   "450 4.4.3 Sender ID check is temporarily unavailable" error code.\
   Alternatively, an SMTP server receiving this result MAY accept a\
   message and optionally subject it to heightened scrutiny by other\
   anti-spam measures.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   This entire document describes a new mechanism for mitigating spoofed\
   e-mail, which is today a pervasive security problem in the Internet.\
\
   Assuming that this mechanism is widely deployed, the following\
   sections describe counter attacks that could be used to defeat this\
   mechanism.\
\

\
RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
6.1.  DNS Attacks\
\
   The new mechanism is entirely dependent on DNS lookups, and is\
   therefore only as secure as DNS.  An attacker bent on spoofing\
   messages could attempt to get his messages accepted by sending forged\
   answers to DNS queries.\
\
   An MTA could largely defeat such an attack by using a properly\
   paranoid DNS resolver.  DNS Security (DNSSEC) may ultimately provide\
   a way to completely neutralize this class of attacks.\
\
6.2.  TCP Attacks\
\
   This mechanism is designed to be used in conjunction with SMTP over\
   TCP.  A sufficiently resourceful attacker might be able to send TCP\
   packets with forged from-addresses, and thus execute an entire SMTP\
   session that appears to come from somewhere other than its true\
   origin.\
\
   Such an attack requires guessing what TCP sequence numbers an SMTP\
   server will use.  It also requires transmitting completely in the\
   blind -- the attack will be unable to hear any of the server's side\
   of the conversation.\
\
   Attacks of this sort can be ameliorated if IP gateways refuse to\
   forward packets when the source address is clearly bogus.\
\
6.3.  Forged Sender Attacks\
\
   This mechanism chooses an address to validate either from one of a\
   number of message headers or from the RFC 2821 MAIL command, and then\
   uses that address for validation.  A message with a true Resent-From\
   header or Return-Path, but a forged From header, will be accepted.\
   Since many MUAs do not display all of the headers of received\
   messages, the message will appear to be forged when displayed.\
\
   In order to neutralize this attack, MUAs will need to start\
   displaying at least the address that was verified.  In addition, MTAs\
   could subject messages to heightened scrutiny when the validated\
   address differs from the From header.\
\
6.4.  Address Space Hijacking\
\
   This mechanism assumes the integrity of IP address space for\
   determining whether a given client is authorized to send messages\
   from a given PRA.  In addition to the TCP attack given in Section\
   6.2, a sufficiently resourceful attacker might be able to alter the\
   IP routing structure to permit two-way communication using a\
\
\

RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   specified IP address.  It would then be possible to execute an SMTP\
   session that appears to come from an authorized address, without the\
   need to guess TCP sequence numbers or transmit in the blind.\
\
   Such an attack might occur if the attacker obtained access to a\
   router that participates in external BGP routing.  Such a router\
   could advertise a more specific route to a rogue SMTP client,\
   temporarily overriding the legitimate owner of the address.\
\
6.5.  Malicious DNS Attacks on Third Parties\
\
   There is class of attacks in which an attacker A can entice a\
   participant P to send a malicious message to a victim V.\
\
   These attacks are undertaken by A citing the address of V in the SMTP\
   MAIL FROM request and then by causing P to generate (or invoke the\
   generation of) a Delivery Status Notification 'bounce' message\
   (RFC3464), which is sent to the victim V.\
\
   The attacker relies upon it being common practice to copy the\
   original message into the 'bounce' report, thereby causing the malice\
   to be sent onward to V.\
\
   This mode of attack has the advantages (to the attacker) of\
   obfuscating the location of the host from which the attack was\
   mounted, and of possibly damaging the reputation of P by making it\
   appear that P originated or was an active participant in the sending\
   of the malicious message.\
\
   In current practice, A causes P to cause the 'bounce' by addressing\
   the original message to a nonexistent recipient.\
\
   Sender ID enables a new variant of this attack.\
\
   In this variant, the attacker A sends a message whose PRA (Section 4)\
   is selected by the attacker to be such that, when P undertakes the\
   Sender ID test, a Fail will result (Section 5.3).\
\
   The message will be rejected (as the attacker intended) and a\
   malicious 'bounce' message may be generated and sent to the victim V.\
\
7.  Implementation Guidance\
\
   This section describes the actions that certain members of the\
   Internet e-mail ecosystem must take to be compliant with this\
   specification.\

RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
7.1.  Simple E-Mailers\
\
   A domain that injects original e-mail into the Internet, using its\
   own name in From headers, need do nothing to be compliant.  However,\
   such domains SHOULD publish records in DNS as defined by [RFC4408]\
   and this specification.\
\
   In the majority of cases, the domain's published information will be\
   the same for both the PRA and MAIL FROM variants of this test.  In\
   this case, domains SHOULD publish their information using an SPF\
   record with the prefix "v=spf1".  Doing so will render their\
   published information usable by the older SPF protocol, too.  (See\
   [RFC4408] for information on the SPF protocol.)\
\
7.2.  E-Mail Forwarders\
\
   In order to pass the PRA variant of the test, a program that forwards\
   received mail to other addresses MUST add an appropriate header that\
   contains an e-mail address that it is authorized to use.  Such\
   programs SHOULD use the Resent-From header for this purpose.\
\
   In order to pass the MAIL FROM variant of the test, a program that\
   forwards received mail to other addresses MUST alter the MAIL FROM\
   address to an address under its control.  Should that address\
   eventually receive a DSN relating to the original message, that DSN\
   SHOULD be forwarded to the original MAIL FROM address.  However, if\
   this altered address receives any messages other than DSNs related to\
   the original message, these messages MUST NOT be forwarded to the\
   original MAIL FROM address; they SHOULD be refused during an SMTP\
   transaction.\
\
   In addition, e-mail forwarders SHOULD publish Sender ID records for\
   their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender ID check\
   yields a "pass" result.\
\
   Some of today's forwarders already add an appropriate header\
   (although many of them use Sender rather than Resent-From.) Most of\
   them do not perform the address-rewriting specified above.\
\
   Note that an e-mail forwarder might receive a single message for two\
   or more recipients, each of whom requests forwarding to a new\
   address.  In this case, the forwarder's MTA SHOULD transmit the\
   message to each new recipient individually, with each copy of the\
   message containing a different newly inserted Resent-From header\
   field.\

\
\
7.3.  Mailing List Servers\
\
   In order to pass the PRA variant of the test, a mailing list server\
   MUST add an appropriate header that contains an e-mail address that\
   it is authorized to use.  Such programs SHOULD use the Resent-From\
   header for this purpose.\
\
   In order to pass the MAIL FROM variant of the test, a mailing list\
   server MUST alter the MAIL FROM address to an address under its\
   control.\
\
   In addition, mailing list servers SHOULD publish Sender ID records\
   for their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender ID check\
   yields a "pass" result.\
\
   Most of today's mailing list software already adds an appropriate\
   header (although most of them use Sender rather than Resent-From),\
   and most of them already alter the MAIL FROM address.\
\
7.4.  Third-Party Mailers\
\
   In order to pass the PRA variant of this test, a program that sends\
   mail on behalf of another user MUST add an appropriate header that\
   contains an e-mail address that it is authorized to use.  Such\
   programs SHOULD use the Sender header for this purpose.\
\
   In order to pass the MAIL FROM variant of this test, a program that\
   sends mail on behalf of another user MUST use a MAIL FROM address\
   that is under its control.  Defining what the program does with any\
   mail received at that address is beyond the scope of this document.\
\
   In addition, third-party mailers, servers SHOULD publish Sender ID\
   records for their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender\
   ID check yields a "pass" result.\
\
   Many, but not all, of today's third-party mailers are already\
   compliant with the PRA variant of the test.  The extent to which\
   mailers are already compliant with the MAIL FROM variant of this test\
   is unknown.\
\
7.5.  MUA Implementers\
\
   When displaying a received message, an MUA SHOULD display the\
   purported responsible address as defined by this document whenever\
   that address differs from the RFC 2822 From address.  This display\
   SHOULD be in addition to the RFC 2822 From address.\

\
RFC 4406            Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail          April 2006\
\
\
   When a received message contains multiple headers that might be used\
   for the purported responsible address determination, an MUA should\
   consider displaying all of them.  That is, if a message contains\
   several Resent-From's, a Sender, and a From, an MUA should consider\
   displaying all of them.\
\
   Sender ID also does not validate the display name that may be\
   transmitted along with an e-mail address.  The display name is also\
   vulnerable to spoofing and other forms of attacks.  In order to\
   reduce the occurrence and effectiveness of such attacks, MUA\
   implementers should consider methods to safeguard the display name.\
   This could include the following:\
\
   * Not presenting the display name to the user at all, or not\
     presenting the display name unless the corresponding e-mail address\
     is listed in the user's address book.\
\
   * Treating as suspicious any e-mail where the display name is itself\
     in the form of an e-mail address, especially when it differs from\
     the actual e-mail address in the header.\
\
   * Making it clear to users that the e-mail address has been checked\
     rather than the display name.\

Abstract\
\
   This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each\
   service to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy,\
   etc.), and specifies what actions are to be taken by a submission\
   server.\
\
   Message relay and final delivery are unaffected, and continue to use\
   SMTP over port 25.\
\
   When conforming to this document, message submission uses the\
   protocol specified here, normally over port 587.\
\
   This separation of function offers a number of benefits, including\
   the ability to apply specific security or policy requirements.\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   SMTP was defined as a message *transfer* protocol, that is, a means\
   to route (if needed) and deliver finished (complete) messages.\
\
   Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) are not supposed to alter the message\
   text, except to add 'Received', 'Return-Path', and other header\
   fields as required by [SMTP-MTA].\
\
   However, SMTP is now also widely used as a message *submission*\
   protocol, that is, a means for Message User Agents (MUAs) to\
   introduce new messages into the MTA routing network.  The process\
   that accepts message submissions from MUAs is termed a Message\
   Submission Agent (MSA).\
\
   In order to permit unconstrained communications, SMTP is not often\
   authenticated during message relay.\
\
   Authentication and authorization of initial submissions have become\
   increasingly important, driven by changes in security requirements\
   and rising expectations that submission servers take responsibility\
   for the message traffic they originate.\
\
   For example, due to the prevalence of machines that have worms,\
   viruses, or other malicious software that generate large amounts of\
   spam, many sites now prohibit outbound traffic on the standard SMTP\
   port (port 25), funneling all mail submissions through submission\
   servers.\
\
   In addition to authentication and authorization issues, messages\
   being submitted are in some cases finished (complete) messages, and\
   in other cases are unfinished (incomplete) in one or more aspects.\
   Unfinished messages may need to be completed to ensure they conform\
   to [MESSAGE-FORMAT], and later requirements.  For example, the\
   message may lack a proper 'Date' header field, and domains might not\
   be fully qualified.  In some cases, the MUA may be unable to generate\
   finished messages (e.g., it might not know its time zone).  Even when\
   submitted messages are complete, local site policy may dictate that\
   the message text be examined or modified in some way, e.g., to\
   conceal local name or address spaces.  Such completions or\
   modifications have been shown to cause harm when performed by\
   downstream MTAs -- that is, MTAs after the first-hop submission MTA\
   -- and are in general considered to be outside the province of\
   standardized MTA functionality.\
\
   Separating messages into submissions and transfers allows developers\
   and network administrators to more easily do the following:\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
   *   Implement security policies and guard against unauthorized mail\
       relaying or injection of unsolicited bulk mail\
\
   *   Implement authenticated submission, including off-site submission\
       by authorized users such as travelers\
\
   *   Separate the relevant software code differences, thereby making\
       each code base more straightforward and allowing for different\
       programs for relay and submission\
\
   *   Detect configuration problems with a site's mail clients\
\
   *   Provide a basis for adding enhanced submission services in the\
       future\
\
   This memo describes a low-cost, deterministic means for messages to\
   be identified as submissions, and specifies what actions are to be\
   taken by a submission server.\
\
2.  Document Information\
\
2.1.  Definitions of Terms Used in This Memo\
\
   Many of the concepts and terms used in this document are defined in\
   [SMTP-MTA]; familiarity with those documents is assumed here.\
\
   Fully-Qualified\
\
   Containing or consisting of a domain that can be globally resolved\
   using the Domain Name Service; that is, not a local alias or partial\
   specification.\
\
   Message Submission Agent (MSA)\
\
   A process that conforms to this specification.  An MSA acts as a\
   submission server to accept messages from MUAs, and either delivers\
   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to an MTA.\
\
   Message Transfer Agent (MTA)\
\
   A process that conforms to [SMTP-MTA].  An MTA acts as an SMTP server\
   to accept messages from an MSA or another MTA, and either delivers\
   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to another MTA.\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
   Message User Agent (MUA)\
\
   A process that acts (often on behalf of a user and with a user\
   interface) to compose and submit new messages, and process delivered\
   messages.\
\
   For delivered messages, the receiving MUA may obtain and process the\
   message according to local conventions or, in what is commonly\
   referred to as a split-MUA model, Post Office Protocol [POP3] or IMAP\
   [IMAP4] is used to access delivered messages, whereas the protocol\
   defined here (or SMTP) is used to submit messages.\
\
2.2.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   In examples, "C:" is used to indicate lines sent by the client, and\
   "S:" indicates those sent by the server.  Line breaks within a\
   command example are for editorial purposes only.\
\
   Examples use the 'example.net' domain.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"\
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].\
\
3.  Message Submission\
\
3.1.  Submission Identification\
\
   Port 587 is reserved for email message submission as specified in\
   this document.  Messages received on this port are defined to be\
   submissions.  The protocol used is ESMTP [SMTP-MTA, ESMTP], with\
   additional restrictions or allowances as specified here.\
\
   Although most email clients and servers can be configured to use port\
   587 instead of 25, there are cases where this is not possible or\
   convenient.  A site MAY choose to use port 25 for message submission,\
   by designating some hosts to be MSAs and others to be MTAs.\
\
3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing\
\
   MTAs and MSAs MAY implement message rejection rules that rely in part\
   on whether the message is a submission or a relay.\
\
   For example, some sites might configure their MTAs to reject all RCPT\
   commands for messages that do not reference local users, and\
   configure their MSA to reject all message submissions that do not\
   come from authorized users, with authorization based either on\
   authenticated identity or the submitting endpoint being within a\
   protected IP environment.\
\
\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
   NOTE:  It is better to reject a message than to risk sending one that\
   is damaged.  This is especially true for problems that are\
   correctable by the MUA, for example, an invalid 'From' field.\
\
   If an MSA is not able to determine a return path to the submitting\
   user, from a valid MAIL FROM, a valid source IP address, or based on\
   authenticated identity, then the MSA SHOULD immediately reject the\
   message.  A message can be immediately rejected by returning a 550\
   code to the MAIL command.\
\
   Note that a null return path, that is, MAIL FROM:<>, is permitted and\
   MUST NOT in itself be cause for rejecting a message.  (MUAs need to\
   generate null return-path messages for a variety of reasons,\
   including disposition notifications.)\
\
   Except in the case where the MSA is unable to determine a valid\
   return path for the message being submitted, text in this\
   specification that instructs an MSA to issue a rejection code MAY be\
   complied with by accepting the message and subsequently generating a\
   bounce message.  (That is, if the MSA is going to reject a message\
   for any reason except being unable to determine a return path, it can\
   optionally do an immediate rejection or accept the message and then\
   mail a bounce.)\
\
   NOTE:  In the normal case of message submission, immediately\
   rejecting the message is preferred, as it gives the user and MUA\
   direct feedback.  To properly handle delayed bounces, the client MUA\
   needs to maintain a queue of messages it has submitted, and match\
   bounces to them.  Note that many contemporary MUAs do not have this\
   capability.\
\
3.3.  Authorized Submission\
\
   Numerous methods have been used to ensure that only authorized users\
   are able to submit messages.  These methods include authenticated\
   SMTP, IP address restrictions, secure IP and other tunnels, and prior\
   POP authentication.\
\
   Authenticated SMTP [SMTP-AUTH] has seen widespread deployment.  It\
   allows the MSA to determine an authorization identity for the message\
   submission, one that is not tied to other protocols.\
\
   IP address restrictions are very widely implemented, but do not allow\
   for travelers and similar situations, and can be easily spoofed\
   unless all transport paths between the MUA and MSA are trustworthy.\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
   Secure IP [IPSEC], and other encrypted and authenticated tunneling\
   techniques, can also be used and provide additional benefits of\
   protection against eavesdropping and traffic analysis.\
\
   Requiring a POP [POP3] authentication (from the same IP address)\
   within some amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes) prior to the start of a\
   message submission session has also been used, but this does impose\
   restrictions on clients as well as servers, which may cause\
   difficulties.  Specifically, the client must do a POP authentication\
   before an SMTP submission session, and not all clients are capable\
   and configured for this.  Also, the MSA must coordinate with the POP\
   server, which may be difficult.  There is also a window during which\
   an unauthorized user can submit messages and appear to be a\
   previously authorized user.  Since it is dependent on the MUA's IP\
   addresses, this technique is substantially as subject to IP address\
   spoofing as validation based on known IP addresses alone (see above).\
\
4.  Mandatory Actions\
\
   An MSA MUST do all of the following:\
\
4.1.  General Submission Rejection Code\
\
   Unless covered by a more precise response code, response code 554 is\
   to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or DATA command that contains\
   something improper.\
\
4.2.  Ensure All Domains Are Fully-Qualified\
\
   The MSA MUST ensure that all domains in the SMTP envelope are fully-\
   qualified.\
\
   If the MSA examines or alters the message text in any way, except to\
   add trace header fields [SMTP-MTA], it MUST ensure that all domains\
   in address header fields are fully-qualified.\
\
   Reply code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or DATA command\
   that contains improper domain references.\
\
   A frequent local convention is to accept single-level domains (e.g.,\
   'sales') and then to expand the reference by adding the remaining\
   portion of the domain name (e.g., to 'sales.example.net').  Local\
   conventions that permit single-level domains SHOULD reject, rather\
   than expand, incomplete multi-level domains (e.g., 'squeaky.sales'),\
   since such expansion is particularly risky.\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
4.3.  Require Authentication\
\
   The MSA MUST by default issue an error response to the MAIL command\
   if the session has not been authenticated using [SMTP-AUTH], unless\
   it has already independently established authentication or\
   authorization (such as being within a protected subnetwork).\
\
   Section 3.3 discusses authentication mechanisms.\
\
   Reply code 530 [SMTP-AUTH] is used for this purpose.\
\
5.  Recommended Actions\
\
   The MSA SHOULD do all of the following:\
\
5.1.  Enforce Address Syntax\
\
   An MSA SHOULD reject messages with illegal syntax in a sender or\
   recipient SMTP envelope address.\
\
   If the MSA examines or alters the message text in way, except to add\
   trace header fields, it SHOULD reject messages with illegal address\
   syntax in address header fields.\
\
   Reply code 501 is to be used to reject a MAIL or RCPT command that\
   contains a detectably improper address.\
\
   When addresses are resolved after submission of the message body,\
   reply code 554 (with a suitable enhanced status code from\
   [SMTP-CODES]) is used after end-of-data, if the message contains\
   invalid addresses in the header.\
\
5.2.  Log Errors\
\
   The MSA SHOULD log message errors, especially apparent\
   misconfigurations of client software.\
\
   It can be very helpful to notify the administrator when problems are\
   detected with local mail clients.  This is another advantage of\
   distinguishing submission from relay: system administrators might be\
   interested in local configuration problems, but not in client\
   problems at other sites.\
\
   Note that it is important to impose limits on such logging to prevent\
   certain forms of denial of service (DoS) attacks.\

\
\
6.  Optional Actions\
\
   The MSA MAY do any of the following:\
\
6.1.  Enforce Submission Rights\
\
   The MSA MAY issue an error response to a MAIL command if the address\
   in MAIL FROM appears to have insufficient submission rights, or is\
   not authorized with the authentication used (if the session has been\
   authenticated).\
\
   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per\
   [SMTP-CODES], such as 5.7.1, is used for this purpose.\
\
6.2.  Enforce Permissions\
\
   The MSA MAY issue an error response to a RCPT command if inconsistent\
   with the permissions given to the user (if the session has been\
   authenticated).\
\
   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per\
   [SMTP-CODES], such as 5.7.1, is used for this purpose.\
\
6.3.  Check Message Data\
\
   The MSA MAY issue an error response to the DATA command or send a\
   failure result after end-of-data if the submitted message is\
   syntactically invalid, or seems inconsistent with permissions given\
   to the user (if known), or violates site policy in some way.\
\
   Reply code 554 is used for syntactic problems in the data.  Reply\
   code 501 is used if the command itself is not syntactically valid.\
   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per\
   [SMTP-CODES] (such as 5.7.1) is used to reject based on the\
   submitting user.  Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status\
   code (such as 5.7.0) is used if the message violates site policy.\
\
6.4.  Support for the Postmaster Address\
\
   If appropriate under local conditions and to facilitate conformance\
   with the "postmaster" requirements of [SMTP-MTA], the MSA MAY permit\
   a reduced degree of authentication for mail addressed to the\
   "postmaster" (or one of its alternate spelling forms, see\
   [SMTP-MTA]), in one or more domains, as compared to requirements\
   enforced for other addresses.  Among other benefits, this provides an\
   address of last resort that can be used by authorized users to report\
   problems that otherwise prevent them from submitting mail.\

7.  Interaction with SMTP Extensions\
\
   The following table lists the current standards-track and\
   Experimental SMTP extensions.  Listed are the EHLO keyword, name, an\
   indication as to the use of the extension on the submit port, and a\
   reference:\
\
Keyword        Name                        Submission  Reference\
----------     --------------------------  ----------  ----------------\
PIPELINING     Pipelining                    SHOULD    [PIPELINING]\
ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES  Enhanced Status Codes   SHOULD    [CODES-EXTENSION]\
ETRN           Extended Turn                 MUST NOT  [ETRN]\
 ...           Extended Codes                SHOULD    [SMTP-CODES]\
DSN            Delivery Status Notification  SHOULD    [DSN]\
SIZE           Message size                  MAY       [SIZE]\
 ...           521 reply code                MUST NOT  [521REPLY]\
CHECKPOINT     Checkpoint/Restart            MAY       [CHECKPOINT]\
BINARYMIME     Binary MIME                   MAY       [CHUNKING]\
CHUNKING       Chunking                      MAY       [CHUNKING]\
8BITMIME       Use 8-bit data                SHOULD    [8BITMIME]\
AUTH           Authentication                MUST      [SMTP-AUTH]\
STARTTLS       Start TLS                     MAY       [Start-TLS]\
NO-SOLICITING  Notification of no soliciting MAY       [Msg-Track]\
MTRK           Message Tracking              MAY       [Msg-Track]\
\
   Future SMTP extensions SHOULD explicitly specify if they are valid on\
   the Submission port.\
\
   Some SMTP extensions are especially useful for message submission:\
\
   Extended Status Codes [SMTP-CODES] SHOULD be supported and used\
   according to [CODES-EXTENSION].  This permits the MSA to notify the\
   client of specific configuration or other problems in more detail\
   than the response codes listed in this memo.  Because some rejections\
   are related to a site's security policy, care should be used not to\
   expose more detail to unauthenticated senders than is needed\
\
   [PIPELINING] SHOULD be supported by the MSA.\
\
   [SMTP-AUTH] allows the MSA to validate the authority and determine\
   the identity of the submitting user and MUST be supported by the MSA.\
\
   Any references to the DATA command in this memo also refer to any\
   substitutes for DATA, such as the BDAT command used with [CHUNKING].\

\
\
8.  Message Modifications\
\
   Sites MAY modify submissions to ensure compliance with standards and\
   site policy.  This section describes a number of such modifications\
   that are often considered useful.\
\
   NOTE:  As a matter of guidance for local decisions to implement\
   message modification, a paramount rule is to limit such actions to\
   remedies for specific problems that have clear solutions.  This is\
   especially true with address elements.  For example, indiscriminately\
   appending a domain to an address or element that lacks one typically\
   results in more broken addresses.  An unqualified address must be\
   verified to be a valid local part in the domain before the domain can\
   be safely added.\
\
   Any message forwarded or delivered by the MSA MUST conform to the\
   requirements of [SMTP-MTA] and [MESSAGE-FORMAT].\
\
8.1.  Add 'Sender'\
\
   The MSA MAY add or replace the 'Sender' field, if the identity of the\
   sender is known and this is not given in the 'From' field.\
\
   The MSA MUST ensure that any address it places in a 'Sender' field is\
   in fact a valid mail address.\
\
8.2.  Add 'Date'\
\
   The MSA MAY add a 'Date' field to the submitted message, if it lacks\
   it, or correct the 'Date' field if it does not conform to\
   [MESSAGE-FORMAT] syntax.\
\
8.3.  Add 'Message-ID'\
\
   The MSA SHOULD add or replace the 'Message-ID' field, if it lacks it,\
   or it is not valid syntax (as defined by [MESSAGE-FORMAT]).  Note\
   that a number of clients still do not generate Message-ID fields.\
\
8.4.  Transfer Encode\
\
   The MSA MAY apply transfer encoding to the message according to MIME\
   conventions, if needed and not harmful to the MIME type.\
\
8.5.  Sign the Message\
\
   The MSA MAY (digitally) sign or otherwise add authentication\
   information to the message.\
\
\
\

RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
8.6.  Encrypt the Message\
\
   The MSA MAY encrypt the message for transport to reflect\
   organizational policies.\
\
   NOTE:  To be useful, the addition of a signature and/or encryption by\
   the MSA generally implies that the connection between the MUA and MSA\
   must itself be secured in some other way, for example, by operating\
   inside of a secure environment, by securing the submission connection\
   at the transport layer, or by using an [SMTP-AUTH] mechanism that\
   provides for session integrity.\
\
8.7.  Resolve Aliases\
\
   The MSA MAY resolve aliases (CNAME records) for domain names, in the\
   SMTP envelope and optionally in address fields of the header, subject\
   to local policy.\
\
   NOTE:  Unconditionally resolving aliases could be harmful.  For\
   example, if www.example.net and ftp.example.net are both aliases for\
   mail.example.net, rewriting them could lose useful information.\
\
8.8.  Header Rewriting\
\
   The MSA MAY rewrite local parts and/or domains in the SMTP envelope,\
   and optionally in address fields of the header, according to local\
   policy.  For example, a site may prefer to rewrite 'JRU' as\
   'J.Random.User' in order to hide login names, and/or to rewrite\
   'squeaky.sales.example.net' as 'zyx.example.net' to hide machine\
   names and make it easier to move users.\
\
   However, only addresses, local-parts, or domains which match specific\
   local MSA configuration settings should be altered.  It would be very\
   dangerous for the MSA to apply data-independent rewriting rules, such\
   as always deleting the first element of a domain name.  So, for\
   example, a rule that strips the left-most element of the domain, if\
   the complete domain matches '*.foo.example.net', would be acceptable.\
\
   The MSA MUST NOT rewrite a forward-pointing (destination) address in\
   a way that violates the constraints of [SMTP-MTA] on modifications of\
   local-parts.\
\
9.  Security Considerations\
\
   Separation of submission and relay of messages allows a site to\
   implement different policies for the two types of services, including\
   requiring use of additional security mechanisms for one or both.  It\
   can do this in a way which is simpler, both technically and\
\
\
\
Gellens & Klensin           Standards Track                    [Page 12]\
\
RFC 4409              Message Submission for Mail             April 2006\
\
\
   administratively.  This increases the likelihood that policies will\
   be applied correctly.\
\
   Separation also can aid in tracking and preventing unsolicited bulk\
   email.\
\
   For example, a site could configure its mail servers such that the\
   MSA requires authentication before accepting a message, and the MTA\
   rejects all RCPT commands for non-local users.  This can be an\
   important element in a site's total email security policy.\
\
   If a site fails to require any form of authorization for message\
   submissions (see section 3.3 for discussion), it is allowing open use\
   of its resources and name; unsolicited bulk email can be injected\
   using its facilities.\
\
   Section 3 includes further discussion of issues with some\
   authentication methods.\
\
   Section 5.2 includes a cautionary note that unlimited logging can\
   enable certain forms of denial of service attacks.\
\
10.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The registration for port 587 has been updated to refer to this memo\
   rather than RFC 2476.\
\
11.  Acknowledgements\
\
   Nathaniel Borenstein and Barry Leiba were instrumental in the\
   development of this update to RFC 2476.\
\
   The original memo (RFC 2476) was developed in part based on comments\
   and discussions which took place on and off the IETF-Submit mailing\
   list.  The help of those who took the time to review that document\
   and make suggestions is appreciated, especially that of Dave Crocker,\
   Ned Freed, Keith Moore, John Myers, and Chris Newman.\
\
   Special thanks to Harald Alvestrand, who got this effort started.\

Status of This Memo\
\
   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.\
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\

\
IESG Note\
\
   The following documents  (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC 4408)\
   are published simultaneously as Experimental RFCs, although there is\
   no general technical consensus and efforts to reconcile the two\
   approaches have failed.  As such, these documents have not received\
   full IETF review and are published "AS-IS" to document the different\
   approaches as they were considered in the MARID working group.\
\
   The IESG takes no position about which approach is to be preferred\
   and cautions the reader that there are serious open issues for each\
   approach and concerns about using them in tandem.  The IESG believes\
   that documenting the different approaches does less harm than not\
   documenting them.\
\
   Note that the Sender ID experiment may use DNS records that may have\
   been created for the current SPF experiment or earlier versions in\
   this set of experiments.  Depending on the content of the record,\
   this may mean that Sender-ID heuristics would be applied incorrectly\
   to a message.  Depending on the actions associated by the recipient\
   with those heuristics, the message may not be delivered or may be\
   discarded on receipt.\
\
   Participants relying on Sender ID experiment DNS records are warned\
   that they may lose valid messages in this set of circumstances.\
   Participants publishing SPF experiment DNS records should consider\
   the advice given in section 3.4 of RFC 4406 and may wish to publish\
   both v=spf1 and spf2.0 records to avoid the conflict.\

\
\
   Participants in the Sender-ID experiment need to be aware that the\
   way Resent-* header fields are used will result in failure to receive\
   legitimate email when interacting with standards-compliant systems\
   (specifically automatic forwarders which comply with the standards by\
   not adding Resent-* headers, and systems which comply with RFC 822\
   but have not yet implemented RFC 2822 Resent-* semantics).  It would\
   be inappropriate to advance Sender-ID on the standards track without\
   resolving this interoperability problem.\
\
   The community is invited to observe the success or failure of the two\
   approaches during the two years following publication, in order that\

Abstract\
\
   This document defines an algorithm by which, given an e-mail message,\
   one can extract the identity of the party that appears to have most\
   proximately caused that message to be delivered.  This identity is\
   called the Purported Responsible Address (PRA).\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Most e-mail flows relatively directly from a sender to a recipient,\
   with a small number of Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) in between.  Some\
   messages, however, are resent by forwarding agents, mailing list\
   servers, and other such software.  These messages effectively result\
   in two or more mail transactions: one from the sender to the\
   forwarding agent, and another from the agent to the destination.\
\
   In some cases, messages travel through more than one of these agents.\
   This can occur, for example, when one mailing list is subscribed to\
   another, or when the address subscribed to a mailing list is a\
   forwarding service.\
\
   Further complicating the situation, in some cases the party that\
   introduces a message is not the author of the message.  For example,\
   many news web sites have a "Mail this article" function that the\

\
   public can use to e-mail a copy of the article to a friend.  In this\
   case, the mail is "from" the person who pressed the button, but is\
   physically sent by the operator of the web site.\
\
   This document defines a new identity associated with an e-mail\
   message, called the Purported Responsible Address (PRA), which is\
   determined by inspecting the header of the message.  The PRA is\
   designed to be the entity that (according to the header) most\
   recently caused the message to be delivered.\
\
   Note that the results of this algorithm are only as truthful as the\
   headers contained in the message; if a message contains fraudulent or\
   incorrect headers, this algorithm will yield an incorrect result.\
   For this reason, the result of the algorithm is called the "Purported\
   Responsible Address" -- "purported" because it tells you what a\
   message claims about where it came from, but not necessarily where it\
   actually came from.\
\
   This document does not prescribe any particular uses for the\
   Purported Responsible Address.  However, [RFC4406] describes a method\
   of determining whether a particular MTA is authorized to send mail on\
   behalf of the domain contained in the PRA.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Determining the Purported Responsible Address\
\
   The PRA of a message is determined by the following algorithm:\
\
   1. Select the first non-empty Resent-Sender header in the message.\
      If no such header is found, continue with step 2.  If it is\
      preceded by a non-empty Resent-From header and one or more\
      Received or Return-Path headers occur after said Resent-From\
      header and before the Resent-Sender header, continue with step 2.\
      Otherwise, proceed to step 5.\
\
   2. Select the first non-empty Resent-From header in the message.  If\
      a Resent-From header is found, proceed to step 5.  Otherwise,\
      continue with step 3.\
\
   3. Select all the non-empty Sender headers in the message.  If there\
      are no such headers, continue with step 4.  If there is exactly\
      one such header, proceed to step 5.  If there is more than one\
      such header, proceed to step 6.\

RFC 4407             Purported Responsible Address            April 2006\
\
\
   4. Select all the non-empty From headers in the message.  If there is\
      exactly one such header, continue with step 5.  Otherwise, proceed\
      to step 6.\
\
   5. A previous step has selected a single header from the message.  If\
      that header is malformed (e.g., it appears to contain multiple\
      mailboxes, or the single mailbox is hopelessly malformed, or the\
      single mailbox does not contain a domain name), continue with step\
      6.  Otherwise, return that single mailbox as the Purported\
      Responsible Address.\
\
   6. The message is ill-formed, and it is impossible to determine a\
      Purported Responsible Address.\
\
   For the purposes of this algorithm, a header field is "non-empty" if\
   and only if it contains any non-whitespace characters.  Header fields\
   that are otherwise relevant but contain only whitespace are ignored\
   and treated as if they were not present.\
\
   Note that steps 1 and 2 above extract the Resent-Sender or Resent-\
   From header from the first resent block (as defined by section 3.6.6\
   of [RFC2822]) if any.  Steps 3 and 4 above extract the Sender or From\
   header if there are no resent blocks.\
\
   Note that what constitutes a hopelessly malformed header or a\
   hopelessly malformed mailbox in step 5 above is a matter for local\
   policy.  Such local policy will never cause two implementations to\
   return different PRAs.  However, it may cause one implementation to\
   return a PRA where another implementation does not.  This will occur\
   only when dealing with a message containing headers of questionable\
   legality.\
\
   Although the algorithm specifies how messages that are not in strict\
   conformance with the provisions of RFC 2822 should be treated for the\
   purposes of determining the PRA, this should not be taken as\
   requiring or recommending that any systems accept such messages when\
   they otherwise would not have done so.  However, if a liberal\
   implementation accepts such messages and desires to know their PRAs,\
   it MUST use the algorithm specified here.\
\
   Where messages conform to RFC 822 rather than RFC 2822, it is\
   possible for the algorithm to give unexpected results.  An RFC822\
   message should not normally contain more than one set of resent\
   headers; however, the placement of those headers is not specified,\
   nor are they required to be contiguous.  It is therefore possible\
   that the Resent-From header will be selected even though a Resent-\
   Sender header is present.  Such cases are expected to be rare or\
   non-existent in practice.\

\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   The PRA, as described by this document, is extracted from message\
   headers that have historically not been verified.  Thus, anyone using\
   the PRA for any purpose MUST be aware that the headers from which it\
   is derived might be fraudulent, malicious, malformed, and/or\
   incorrect.  [RFC4406] describes one mechanism for validating the PRA.\
\
   A message's PRA will often be extracted from a header field that is\
   not normally displayed by existing mail user agent software.  If the\
   PRA is used as part of a mechanism to authenticate the message's\
   origin, the message SHOULD NOT be displayed with an indication of its\
   authenticity (positive or negative) without the PRA header field also\
   being displayed.\
\

   The PRA concept was first published in [CallerID].  It has been\
   refined using valuable suggestions from members of the MARID working\
   group.\
