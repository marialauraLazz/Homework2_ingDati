RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
1.  Scope and Introduction\
\
   As Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is becoming a more widespread\
   technology for providing IP virtual private network (VPN) services,\
   the security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture is of increasing\
   concern to service providers and VPN customers.  This document gives\
   an overview of the security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture that\
   is described in RFC 4364 [1], and compares it with the security of\
   traditional layer-2 services such as ATM or Frame Relay.\
\
   The term "MPLS core" is defined for this document as the set of\
   Provider Edge (PE) and provider (P) routers that provide a BGP/MPLS\
   IP VPN service, typically under the control of a single service\
   provider (SP).  This document assumes that the MPLS core network is\
   trusted and secure.  Thus, it does not address basic security\
   concerns such as securing the network elements against unauthorised\
   access, misconfigurations of the core, or attacks internal to the\
   core.  A customer that does not wish to trust the service provider\
   network must use additional security mechanisms such as IPsec over\
   the MPLS infrastructure.\
\
   This document analyses only the security features of BGP/MPLS IP\
   VPNs, not the security of routing protocols in general.  IPsec\
   technology is also not covered, except to highlight the combination\
   of MPLS VPNs with IPsec.\
\
   The overall security of a system has three aspects: the architecture,\
   the implementation, and the operation of the system.  Security issues\
   can exist in any of these aspects.  This document analyses only the\
   architectural security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, not implementation or\
   operational security issues.\
\
   This document is targeted at technical staff of service providers and\
   enterprises.  Knowledge of the basic BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture as\
   described in RFC 4364 [1] is required to understand this document.\
   For specific Layer 3 VPN terminology and reference models refer to\
   [11].\
\
   Section 2 of this document specifies the typical VPN requirements a\
   VPN user might have, and section 3 analyses how RFC 4364 [1]\
   addresses these requirements.  Section 4 discusses specific security\
   issues of multi-AS (Autonomous System) MPLS architectures, and\
   section 5 lists security features that are not covered by this\
   architecture and therefore need to be addressed separately.  Section\
   6 highlights potential security issues on layer 2 that might impact\
   the overall security of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN service.  The findings of\
   this document are summarized in section 7.\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
2.  Security Requirements of VPN Networks\
\
   Both service providers offering any type of VPN services and\
   customers using them have specific demands for security.  Mostly,\
   they compare MPLS-based solutions with traditional layer 2-based VPN\
   solutions such as Frame Relay and ATM, since these are widely\
   deployed and accepted.  This section outlines the typical security\
   requirements for VPN networks.  The following section discusses if\
   and how BGP/MPLS IP VPNs address these requirements, for both the\
   MPLS core and the connected VPNs.\
\
2.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation\
\
   Non-intersecting layer 3 VPNs of the same VPN service are assumed to\
   have independent address spaces.  For example, two non-intersecting\
   VPNs may each use the same 10/8 network addresses without conflict.\
   In addition, traffic from one VPN must never enter another VPN.  This\
   implies separation of routing protocol information, so that routing\
   tables must also be separate per VPN.  Specifically:\
\
   o  Any VPN must be able to use the same address space as any other\
      VPN.\
   o  Any VPN must be able to use the same address space as the MPLS\
      core.\
   o  Traffic, including routing traffic, from one VPN must never flow\
      to another VPN.\
   o  Routing information, as well as distribution and processing of\
      that information, for one VPN instance must be independent from\
      any other VPN instance.\
   o  Routing information, as well as distribution and processing of\
      that information, for one VPN instance must be independent from\
      the core.\
\
   From a security point of view, the basic requirement is to prevent\
   packets destined to a host a.b.c.d within a given VPN reaching a host\
   with the same address in another VPN or in the core, and to prevent\
   routing packets to another VPN even if it does not contain that\
   destination address.\
\
   Confidentiality, as defined in the L3VPN Security Framework [11], is\
   a requirement that goes beyond simple isolation of VPNs and provides\
   protection against eavesdropping on any transmission medium.\
   Encryption is the mechanism used to provide confidentiality.  This\
   document considers confidentiality an optional VPN requirement, since\
   many existing VPN deployments do not encrypt transit traffic.\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
2.2.  Hiding the Core Infrastructure\
\
   The internal structure of the core network (MPLS PE and P elements)\
   should not be externally visible.  Whilst breaking this requirement\
   is not a security problem in itself, many service providers believe\
   it is advantageous if the internal addresses and network structure\
   are hidden from the outside world.  An argument is that denial-of-\
   service (DoS) attacks against a core router are much easier to carry\
   out if an attacker knows the router addresses.  Addresses can always\
   be guessed, but attacks are more difficult if addresses are not\
   known.  The core should be as invisible to the outside world as a\
   comparable layer 2 infrastructure (e.g., Frame Relay, ATM).  Core\
   network elements should also not be accessible from within a VPN.\
\
   Security should never rely entirely on obscurity, i.e., the hiding of\
   information.  Services should be equally secure if the implementation\
   is known.  However, there is a strong market perception that hiding\
   of details is advantageous.  This point addresses that market\
   perception.\
\
2.3.  Resistance to Attacks\
\
   There are two basic types of attacks: DoS attacks, where resources\
   become unavailable to authorised users, and intrusions, where\
   resources become available to unauthorised users.  BGP/MPLS IP VPN\
   networks must provide at least the same level of protection against\
   both forms of attack as current layer 2 networks.\
\
   For intrusions, there are two fundamental ways to protect the\
   network: first, to harden protocols that could be abused (e.g.,\
   Telnet into a router), and second, to make the network as\
   inaccessible as possible.  This is achieved by a combination of\
   packet filtering / firewalling and address hiding, as discussed\
   above.\
\
   DoS attacks are easier to execute, since a single known IP address\
   might be enough information to attack a machine.  This can be done\
   using normal "permitted" traffic, but using higher than normal packet\
   rates, so that other users cannot access the targeted machine.  The\
   only way to be invulnerable to this kind of attack is to make sure\
   that machines are not reachable, again by packet filtering and\
   optionally by address hiding.\
\
   This document concentrates on protecting the core network against\
   attacks from the "outside", i.e., the Internet and connected VPNs.\
   Protection against attacks from the "inside", i.e., an attacker who\
   has logical or physical access to the core network, is not discussed\
   here.\

\
\
2.4.  Impossibility of Label Spoofing\
\
   Assuming the address and traffic separation discussed above, an\
   attacker might try to access other VPNs by inserting packets with a\
   label that he does not "own".  This could be done from the outside,\
   i.e., another Customer Edge (CE) router or from the Internet, or from\
   within the MPLS core.  The latter case (from within the core) will\
   not be discussed, since we assume that the core network is provided\
   securely.  Should protection against an insecure core be required, it\
   is necessary to use security protocols such as IPsec across the MPLS\
   infrastructure, at least from CE to CE, since the PEs belong to the\
   core.\
\
   Depending on the way that CE routers are connected to PE routers, it\
   might be possible to intrude into a VPN that is connected to the same\
   PE, using layer 2 attack mechanisms such as 802.1Q-label spoofing or\
   ATM VPI/VCI spoofing.  Layer 2 security issues will be discussed in\
   section 6.\
\
   It is required that VPNs cannot abuse the MPLS label mechanisms or\
   protocols to gain unauthorised access to other VPNs or the core.\
\
3.  Analysis of BGP/MPLS IP VPN Security\
\
   In this section, the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture is analysed with\
   respect to the security requirements listed above.\
\
3.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation\
\
   BGP/MPLS allows distinct IP VPNs to use the same address space, which\
   can also be private address space (RFC 1918 [2]).  This is achieved\
   by adding a 64-bit Route Distinguisher (RD) to each IPv4 route,\
   making VPN-unique addresses also unique in the MPLS core.  This\
   "extended" address is also called a "VPN-IPv4 address".  Thus,\
   customers of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN service do not need to change their\
   current addressing plan.\
\
   Each PE router maintains a separate Virtual Routing and Forwarding\
   instance (VRF) for each connected VPN.  A VRF includes the addresses\
   of that VPN as well as the addresses of the PE routers with which the\
   CE routers are peering.  All addresses of a VRF, including these PE\
   addresses, belong logically to the VPN and are accessible from the\
   VPN.  The fact that PE addresses are accessible to the VPN is not an\
   issue if static routing is used between the PE and CE routers, since\
   packet filters can be deployed to block access to all addresses of\
   the VRF on the PE router.  If dynamic routing protocols are used, the\
   CE routers need to have the address of the peer PE router in the core\
   configured.  In an environment where the service provider manages the\
\

\
\
   CE routers as CPE, this can be invisible to the customer.  The\
   address space on the CE-PE link (including the peering PE address) is\
   considered part of the VPN address space.  Since address space can\
   overlap between VPNs, the CE-PE link addresses can overlap between\
   VPNs.  For practical management considerations, SPs typically address\
   CE-PE links from a global pool, maintaining uniqueness across the\
   core.\
\
   Routing separation between VPNs can also be achieved.  Each VRF is\
   populated with routes from one VPN through statically configured\
   routes or through routing protocols that run between the PE and CE\
   router.  Since each VPN is associated with a separate VRF there is no\
   interference between VPNs on the PE router.\
\
   Across the core to the other PE routers separation is maintained with\
   unique VPN identifiers in multiprotocol BGP, the Route Distinguishers\
   (RDs).  VPN routes including the RD are exclusively exchanged between\
   PE routers by Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP, RFC 2858 [8]) across the\
   core.  These BGP routing updates are not re-distributed into the\
   core, but only to the other PE routers, where the information is kept\
   again in VPN-specific VRFs.  Thus, routing across a BGP/MPLS network\
   is separate per VPN.\
\
   On the data plane, traffic separation is achieved by the ingress PE\
   pre-pending a VPN-specific label to the packets.  The packets with\
   the VPN labels are sent through the core to the egress PE, where the\
   VPN label is used to select the egress VRF.\
\
   Given the addressing, routing, and traffic separation across an BGP/\
   MPLS IP VPN core network, it can be assumed that this architecture\
   offers in this respect the same security as a layer-2 VPN.  It is not\
   possible to intrude from a VPN or the core into another VPN unless\
   this has been explicitly configured.\
\
   If and when confidentiality is required, it can be achieved in BGP/\
   MPLS IP VPNs by overlaying encryption services over the network.\
   However, encryption is not a standard service on BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.\
   See also section 5.2.\
\
3.2.  Hiding of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN Core Infrastructure\
\
   Service providers and end-customers do not normally want their\
   network topology revealed to the outside.  This makes attacks more\
   difficult to execute: If an attacker doesn't know the address of a\
   victim, he can only guess the IP addresses to attack.  Since most DoS\
   attacks don't provide direct feedback to the attacker it would be\
   difficult to attack the network.  It has to be mentioned specifically\
\
\
\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
   that information hiding as such does not provide security.  However,\
   in the market this is a perceived requirement.\
\
   With a known IP address, a potential attacker can launch a DoS attack\
   more easily against that device.  Therefore, the ideal is to not\
   reveal any information about the internal network to the outside\
   world.  This applies to the customer network and the core.  A number\
   of additional security measures also have to be taken: most of all,\
   extensive packet filtering.\
\
   For security reasons, it is recommended for any core network to\
   filter packets from the "outside" (Internet or connected VPNs)\
   destined to the core infrastructure.  This makes it very hard to\
   attack the core, although some functionality such as pinging core\
   routers will be lost.  Traceroute across the core will still work,\
   since it addresses a destination outside the core.\
\
   MPLS does not reveal unnecessary information to the outside, not even\
   to customer VPNs.  The addressing of the core can be done with\
   private addresses (RFC 1918 [2]) or public addresses.  Since the\
   interface to the VPNs as well as the Internet is BGP, there is no\
   need to reveal any internal information.  The only information\
   required in the case of a routing protocol between PE and CE is the\
   address of the PE router.  If no dynamic routing is required, static\
   routing on unnumbered interfaces can be configured between the PE and\
   CE.  With this measure, the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be kept\
   completely hidden.\
\
   Customer VPNs must advertise their routes to the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core\
   (dynamically or statically), to ensure reachability across their VPN.\
   In some cases, VPN users prefer that the service provider have no\
   visibility of the addressing plan of the VPN.  The following has to\
   be noted: First, the information known to the core is not about\
   specific hosts, but networks (routes); this offers a degree of\
   abstraction.  Second, in a VPN-only BGP/MPLS IP VPN network (no\
   Internet access) this is equal to existing layer-2 models, where the\
   customer has to trust the service provider.  Also, in a Frame Relay\
   or ATM network, routing and addressing information about the VPNs can\
   be seen on the core network.\
\
   In a VPN service with shared Internet access, the service provider\
   will typically announce the routes of customers who wish to use the\
   Internet to his upstream or peer providers.  This can be done\
   directly if the VPN customer uses public address space, or via\
   Network Address Translation (NAT) to obscure the addressing\
   information of the customers' networks.  In either case, the customer\
   does not reveal more information than would be revealed by a general\
   Internet service.  Core information will not be revealed, except for\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
   the peering address(es) of the PE router(s) that hold(s) the peering\
   with the Internet.  These addresses must be secured as in a\
   traditional IP backbone.\
\
   In summary, in a pure MPLS-VPN service, where no Internet access is\
   provided, information hiding is as good as on a comparable FR or ATM\
   network.  No addressing information is revealed to third parties or\
   the Internet.  If a customer chooses to access the Internet via the\
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN core, he will have to reveal the same information as\
   required for a normal Internet service.  NAT can be used for further\
   obscurity.  Being reachable from the Internet automatically exposes a\
   customer network to additional security threats.  Appropriate\
   security mechanisms have to be deployed such as firewalls and\
   intrusion detection systems.  This is true for any Internet access,\
   over MPLS or direct.\
\
   A BGP/MPLS IP VPN network with no interconnections to the Internet\
   has security equal to that of FR or ATM VPN networks.  With an\
   Internet access from the MPLS cloud, the service provider has to\
   reveal at least one IP address (of the peering PE router) to the next\
   provider, and thus to the outside world.\
\
3.3.  Resistance to Attacks\
\
   Section 3.1 shows that it is impossible to directly intrude into\
   other VPNs.  Another possibility is to attack the MPLS core and try\
   to attack other VPNs from there.  As shown above, it is impossible to\
   address a P router directly.  The only addresses reachable from a VPN\
   or the Internet are the peering addresses of the PE routers.  Thus,\
   there are two basic ways that the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be\
   attacked:\
\
   1.  By attacking the PE routers directly.\
   2.  By attacking the signaling mechanisms of MPLS (mostly routing).\
\
   To attack an element of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN network, it is first\
   necessary to know the address of the element.  As discussed in\
   section 3.2, the addressing structure of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core is\
   hidden from the outside world.  Thus, an attacker cannot know the IP\
   address of any router in the core to attack.  The attacker could\
   guess addresses and send packets to these addresses.  However, due to\
   the address separation of MPLS each incoming packet will be treated\
   as belonging to the address space of the customer.  Thus, it is\
   impossible to reach an internal router, even by guessing IP\
   addresses.  There is only one exception to this rule, which is the\
   peer interface of the PE router.  This address of the PE is the only\
   attack point from the outside (a VPN or Internet).\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
   The routing between a VPN and the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be\
   configured two ways:\
\
   1.  Static: In this case, the PE routers are configured with static\
       routes to the networks behind each CE, and the CEs are configured\
       to statically point to the PE router for any network in other\
       parts of the VPN (mostly a default route).  There are two sub-\
       cases: The static route can point to the IP address of the PE\
       router or to an interface of the CE router (e.g., serial0).\
   2.  Dynamic: A routing protocol (e.g., Routing Information Protocol\
       (RIP), OSPF, BGP) is used to exchange routing information between\
       the CE and PE at each peering point.\
\
   In the case of a static route that points to an interface, the CE\
   router doesn't need to know any IP addresses of the core network or\
   even of the PE router.  This has the disadvantage of needing a more\
   extensive (static) configuration, but is the most secure option.  In\
   this case, it is also possible to configure packet filters on the PE\
   interface to deny any packet to the PE interface.  This protects the\
   router and the whole core from attack.\
\
   In all other cases, each CE router needs to know at least the router\
   ID (RID, i.e., peer IP address) of the PE router in the core, and\
   thus has a potential destination for an attack.  One could imagine\
   various attacks on various services running on a router.  In\
   practice, access to the PE router over the CE-PE interface can be\
   limited to the required routing protocol by using access control\
   lists (ACLs).  This limits the point of attack to one routing\
   protocol, for example, BGP.  A potential attack could be to send an\
   extensive number of routes, or to flood the PE router with routing\
   updates.  Both could lead to a DoS, however, not to unauthorised\
   access.\
\
   To reduce this risk, it is necessary to configure the routing\
   protocol on the PE router to operate as securely as possible.  This\
   can be done in various ways:\
\
   o  By accepting only routing protocol packets, and only from the CE\
      router.  The inbound ACL on each CE interface of the PE router\
      should allow only routing protocol packets from the CE to the PE.\
   o  By configuring MD5 authentication for routing protocols.  This is\
      available for BGP (RFC 2385 [6]), OSPF (RFC 2154 [4]), and RIP2\
      (RFC 2082 [3]), for example.  This avoids packets being spoofed\
      from other parts of the customer network than the CE router.  It\
      requires the service provider and customer to agree on a shared\
      secret between all CE and PE routers.  It is necessary to do this\
      for all VPN customers.  It is not sufficient to do this only for\
      the customer with the highest security requirements.\

\
\
   o  By configuring parameters of the routing protocol to further\
      secure this communication.  For example, the rate of routing\
      updates should be restricted where possible (in BGP through\
      damping); a maximum number of routes accepted per VRF and per\
      routing neighbor should be configured where possible; and the\
      Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM; RFC 3682 [10]) should be\
      used for all supported protocols.\
\
   In summary, it is not possible to intrude from one VPN into other\
   VPNs, or the core.  However, it is theoretically possible to attack\
   the routing protocol port to execute a DoS attack against the PE\
   router.  This in turn might have a negative impact on other VPNs on\
   this PE router.  For this reason, PE routers must be extremely well\
   secured, especially on their interfaces to CE routers.  ACLs must be\
   configured to limit access only to the port(s) of the routing\
   protocol, and only from the CE router.  Further routing protocols'\
   security mechanisms such as MD5 authentication, maximum prefix\
   limits, and Time to Live (TTL) security mechanisms should be used on\
   all PE-CE peerings.  With all these security measures, the only\
   possible attack is a DoS attack against the routing protocol itself.\
   BGP has a number of countermeasures such as prefix filtering and\
   damping built into the protocol, to assist with stability.  It is\
   also easy to track the source of such a potential DoS attack.\
   Without dynamic routing between CEs and PEs, the security is\
   equivalent to the security of ATM or Frame Relay networks.\
\
3.4.  Label Spoofing\
\
   Similar to IP spoofing attacks, where an attacker fakes the source IP\
   address of a packet, it is also theoretically possible to spoof the\
   label of an MPLS packet.  In the first section, the assumption was\
   made that the core network is trusted.  If this assumption cannot be\
   made, IPsec must be run over the MPLS cloud.  Thus in this section\
   the emphasis is on whether it is possible to insert packets with\
   spoofed labels into the MPLS network from the outside, i.e., from a\
   VPN (CE router) or from the Internet.\
\
   The interface between a CE router and its peering PE router is an IP\
   interface, i.e., without labels.  The CE router is unaware of the\
   MPLS core, and thinks it is sending IP packets to another router.\
   The "intelligence" is done in the PE device, where, based on the\
   configuration, the label is chosen and pre-pended to the packet.\
   This is the case for all PE routers, towards CE routers as well as\
   the upstream service provider.  All interfaces into the MPLS cloud\
   only require IP packets, without labels.\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
   For security reasons, a PE router should never accept a packet with a\
   label from a CE router.  RFC 3031 [9] specifies: "Therefore, when a\
   labeled packet is received with an invalid incoming label, it MUST be\
   discarded, UNLESS it is determined by some means (not within the\
   scope of the current document) that forwarding it unlabeled cannot\
   cause any harm."  Since accepting labels on the CE interface would\
   potentially allow passing packets to other VPNs it is not permitted\
   by the RFC.\
\
   Thus, it is impossible for an outside attacker to send labeled\
   packets into the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core.\
\
   There remains the possibility to spoof the IP address of a packet\
   being sent to the MPLS core.  Since there is strict address\
   separation within the PE router, and each VPN has its own VRF, this\
   can only harm the VPN the spoofed packet originated from; that is, a\
   VPN customer can attack only himself.  MPLS doesn't add any security\
   risk here.\
\
   The Inter-AS and Carrier's Carrier cases are special cases, since on\
   the interfaces between providers typically packets with labels are\
   exchanged.  See section 4 for an analysis of these architectures.\
\
3.5.  Comparison with ATM/FR VPNs\
\
   ATM and FR VPN services enjoy a very high reputation in terms of\
   security.  Although ATM and FR VPNs can be provided in a secure\
   manner, it has been reported that these technologies also can have\
   security vulnerabilities [14].  In ATM/FR as in any other networking\
   technology, the security depends on the configuration of the network\
   being secure, and errors can also lead to security problems.\
\
4.  Security of Advanced BGP/MPLS IP VPN Architectures\
\
   The BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture described in RFC 2547 [7] defines\
   the PE-CE interface as the only external interface seen from the\
   service provider network.  In this case, the PE treats the CE as\
   untrusted and only accepts IP packets from the CE.  The IP address\
   range is treated as belonging to the VPN of the CE, so the PE\
   maintains full control over VPN separation.\
\
   RFC 4364 [1] has subsequently defined a more complex architecture,\
   with more open interfaces.  These interfaces allow the exchange of\
   label information and labeled packets to and from devices outside the\
   control of the service provider.  This section discusses the security\
   implications of this advanced architecture.\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
4.1.  Carriers' Carrier\
\
   In the Carriers' Carrier (CsC) architecture, the CE is linked to a\
   VRF on the PE.  The CE may send labeled packets to the PE.  The label\
   has been previously assigned by the PE to the CE, and represents the\
   label switched path (LSP) from this CE to the remote CE via the\
   carrier's network.\
\
   RFC 4364 [1] specifies for this case: "When the PE receives a labeled\
   packet from a CE, it must verify that the top label is one that was\
   distributed to that CE."  This ensures that the CE can only use\
   labels that the PE correctly associates with the corresponding VPN.\
   Packets with incorrect labels will be discarded, and thus label\
   spoofing is impossible.\
\
   The use of label maps on the PE leaves the control of the label\
   information entirely with the PE, so that this has no impact on the\
   security of the solution.\
\
   The packet underneath the top label will -- as in standard RFC 2547\
   [7] networks -- remain local to the customer carrier's VPN and not be\
   inspected in the carriers' carrier core.  Potential spoofing of\
   subsequent labels or IP addresses remains local to the carrier's VPN;\
   it has no implication on the carriers' carrier core nor on other VPNs\
   in that core.  This is specifically stated in section 6 of RFC 4364\
   [1].\
\
   Note that if the PE and CE are interconnected using a shared layer 2\
   infrastructure such as a switch, attacks are possible on layer 2,\
   which might enable a third party on the shared layer 2 network to\
   intrude into a VPN on that PE router.  RFC 4364 [1] specifies\
   therefore that either all devices on a shared layer 2 network have to\
   be part of the same VPN, or the layer 2 network must be split\
   logically to avoid this issue.  This will be discussed in more detail\
   in section 6.\
\
   In the CsC architecture, the customer carrier needs to trust the\
   carriers' carrier for correct configuration and operation.  The\
   customer of the carrier thus implicitly needs to trust both his\
   carrier and the carriers' carrier.\
\
   In summary, a correctly configured carriers' carrier network provides\
   the same level of security as comparable layer 2 networks or\
   traditional RFC 2547 [7] networks.\

\
\
4.2.  Inter-Provider Backbones\
\
   RFC 4364 [1] specifies three sub-cases for the inter-provider\
   backbone (Inter-AS) case.\
\
   a) VRF-to-VRF connections at the autonomous system border routers\
   (ASBRs).\
\
   In this case, each PE sees and treats the other PE as a CE; each will\
   not accept labeled packets, and there is no signaling between the PEs\
   other than inside the VRFs on both sides.  Thus, the separation of\
   the VPNs on both sides and the security of those are the same as on a\
   single AS RFC 2547 [7] network.  This has already been shown to have\
   the same security properties as traditional layer 2 VPNs.\
\
   This solution has potential scalability issues in that the ASBRs need\
   to maintain a VRF per VPN, and all of the VRFs need to hold all\
   routes of the specific VPNs.  Thus, an ASBR can run into memory\
   problems affecting all VPNs if one single VRF contains too many\
   routes.  Thus, the service providers needs to ensure that the ASBRs\
   are properly dimensioned and apply appropriate security measures such\
   as limiting the number of prefixes per VRF.\
\
   The two service providers connecting their VPNs in this way must\
   trust each other.  Since the VPNs are separated on different\
   (sub-)interfaces, all signaling between ASBRs remains within a given\
   VPN.  This means that dynamic cross-VPN security breaches are\
   impossible.  It is conceivable that a service provider connects a\
   specific VPN to the wrong interface, thus interconnecting two VPNs\
   that should not be connected.  This must be controlled operationally.\
\
   b) EBGP redistribution of labeled VPN-IPv4 routes from AS to\
   neighboring AS.\
\
   In this case, ASBRs on both sides hold full routing information for\
   all shared VPNs on both sides.  This is not held in separate VRFs,\
   but in the BGP database.  (This is typically limited to the Inter-AS\
   VPNs through filtering.)  The separation inside the PE is maintained\
   through the use of VPN-IPv4 addresses.  The control plane between the\
   ASBRs uses Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP, RFC 2858 [8]).  It exchanges\
   VPN routes as VPN-IPv4 addresses, the ASBR addresses as BGP next-hop\
   IPv4 addresses, and labels to be used in the data plane.\
\
   The data plane is separated through the use of a single label,\
   representing a VRF or a subset thereof.  RFC 4364 [1] states that an\
   ASBR should only accept packets with a label that it has assigned to\
   this router.  This prevents the insertion of packets with unknown\
   labels, but it is possible for a service provider to use any label\

\
\
   that the ASBR of the other provider has passed on.  This allows one\
   provider to insert packets into any VPN of the other provider for\
   which it has a label.\
\
   This solution also needs to consider the security on layer 2 at the\
   interconnection.  The RFC states that this type of interconnection\
   should only be implemented on private interconnection points.  See\
   section 6 for more details.\
\
   RFC 4364 [1] states that a trust relationship between the two\
   connecting ASes must exist for this model to work securely.\
   Effectively, all ASes interconnected in this way form a single zone\
   of trust.  The VPN customer needs to trust all the service providers\
   involved in the provisioning of his VPN on this architecture.\
\
   c) PEs exchange labeled VPN-IPv4 routes, ASBRs only exchange\
   loopbacks of PEs with labels.\
\
   In this solution, there are effectively two control connections\
   between ASes.  The route reflectors (RRs) exchange the VPN-IPv4\
   routes via multihop eBGP.  The ASBRs only exchange the labeled\
   addresses of those PE routers that hold VPN routes that are shared\
   between those ASes.  This maintains scalability for the ASBRs, since\
   they do not need to know the VPN-IPv4 routes.\
\
   In this solution, the top label specifies an LSP to an egress PE\
   router, and the second label specifies a VPN connected to this egress\
   PE.  The security of the ASBR connection has the same constraints as\
   in solution b): An ASBR should only accept packets with top labels\
   that it has assigned to the other router, thus verifying that the\
   packet is addressed to a valid PE router.  Any label, which was\
   assigned to the other ASBR, will be accepted.  It is impossible for\
   an ASBR to distinguish between different egress PEs or between\
   different VPNs on those PEs.  A malicious service provider of one AS\
   could introduce packets into any VPN on a PE of the other AS; it only\
   needs a valid LSP on its ASBR and PEs to the corresponding PE on the\
   other AS.  The VPN label can be statistically guessed from the\
   theoretical label space, which allows unidirectional traffic into a\
   VPN.\
\
   This means that such an ASBR-ASBR connection can only be made with a\
   trusted party over a private interface, as described in b).\
\
   In addition, this solution exchanges labeled VPN-IPv4 addresses\
   between route reflectors (RRs) via MP-eBGP.  The control plane itself\
   can be protected via routing authentication (RFC 2385 [6]), which\
   ensures that the routing information has been originated by the\
   expected RR and has not been modified in transit.  The received VPN\

\
\
   information cannot be verified, as in the previous case.  Thus, a\
   service provider can introduce bogus routes for any shared VPN.  The\
   ASes need to trust each other to configure their respective networks\
   correctly.  All ASes involved in this design form one trusted zone.\
   The customer needs to trust all service providers involved.\
\
   The difference between case b) and case c) is that in b) the ASBRs\
   act as iBGP next-hops for their AS; thus, each SP needs to know of\
   the other SP's core only the addresses of the ASBRs.  In case c), the\
   SPs exchange the loopback addresses of their PE routers; thus, each\
   SP reveals information to the other about its PE routers, and these\
   routers must be accessible from the other AS.  As stated above,\
   accessibility does not necessarily mean insecurity, and networks\
   should never rely on "security through obscurity".  This should not\
   be an issue if the PE routers are appropriately secured.  However,\
   there is an increasing perception that network devices should\
   generally not be accessible.\
\
   In addition, there are scalability considerations for case c).  A\
   number of BGP peerings have to be made for the overall network\
   including all ASes linked this way.  SPs on both sides need to work\
   together in defining a scalable architecture, probably with route\
   reflectors.\
\
   In summary, all of these Inter-AS solutions logically merge several\
   provider networks.  For all cases of Inter-AS configuration, all ASes\
   form a single zone of trust and service providers need to trust each\
   other.  For the VPN customer, the security of the overall solution is\
   equal to the security of traditional RFC 2547 [7] networks, but the\
   customer needs to trust all service providers involved in the\
   provisioning of this Inter-AS solution.\
\
5.  What BGP/MPLS IP VPNs Do Not Provide\
\
5.1.  Protection against Misconfigurations of the Core and Attacks\
      'within' the Core\
\
   The security mechanisms discussed here assume correct configuration\
   of the network elements of the core network (PE and P routers).\
   Deliberate or inadvertent misconfiguration may result in severe\
   security leaks.\
\
   Note that this paragraph specifically refers to the core network,\
   i.e., the PE and P elements.  Misconfigurations of any of the\
   customer side elements such as the CE router are covered by the\
   security mechanisms above.  This means that a potential attacker must\
   have access to either PE or P routers to gain advantage from\
   misconfigurations.  If an attacker has access to core elements, or is\

\
\
   able to insert into the core additional equipment, he will be able to\
   attack both the core network and the connected VPNs.  Thus, the\
   following is important:\
\
   o  To avoid the risk of misconfigurations, it is important that the\
      equipment is easy to configure and that SP staff have the\
      appropriate training and experience when configuring the network.\
      Proper tools are required to configure the core network.\
   o  To minimise the risk of "internal" attacks, the core network must\
      be properly secured.  This includes network element security,\
      management security, physical security of the service provider\
      infrastructure, access control to service provider installations,\
      and other standard SP security mechanisms.\
\
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs can only provide a secure service if the core\
   network is provided in a secure fashion.  This document assumes this\
   to be the case.\
\
   There are various approaches to control the security of a core if the\
   VPN customer cannot or does not want to trust the service provider.\
   IPsec from customer-controlled devices is one of them.  The document\
   "CE-to-CE Member Verification for Layer 3 VPNs" [13] proposes a\
   CE-based authentication scheme using tokens, aimed at detecting\
   misconfigurations in the MPLS core.  The document "MPLS VPN\
   Import/Export Verification" [12] proposes a similar scheme based on\
   using the MD5 routing authentication.  Both schemes aim to detect and\
   prevent misconfigurations in the core.\
\
5.2.  Data Encryption, Integrity, and Origin Authentication\
\
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs themselves do not provide encryption, integrity, or\
   authentication service.  If these are required, IPsec should be used\
   over the MPLS infrastructure.  The same applies to ATM and Frame\
   Relay: IPsec can provide these missing services.\
\
5.3.  Customer Network Security\
\
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs can be secured so that they are comparable with\
   other VPN services.  However, the security of the core network is\
   only one factor for the overall security of a customer's network.\
   Threats in today's networks do not come only from an "outside"\
   connection, but also from the "inside" and from other entry points\
   (modems, for example).  To reach a good security level for a customer\
   network in a BGP/MPLS infrastructure, MPLS security is necessary but\
   not sufficient.  The same applies to other VPN technologies like ATM\
   or Frame Relay.  See also RFC 2196 [5] for more information on how to\
   secure a network.\

\
\
6.  Layer 2 Security Considerations\
\
   In most cases of Inter-AS or Carrier's Carrier solutions, a network\
   will be interconnected to other networks via a point-to-point private\
   connection.  This connection cannot be interfered with by third\
   parties.  It is important to understand that the use of any\
   shared-medium layer 2 technology for such interconnections, such as\
   Ethernet switches, may carry additional security risks.\
\
   There are two types of risks with layer 2 infrastructure:\
\
   a) Attacks against layer 2 protocols or mechanisms\
\
   Risks in a layer 2 environment include many different forms of\
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attacks, VLAN trunking attacks, or\
   Content Addressable Memory (CAM) overflow attacks.  For example, ARP\
   spoofing allows an attacker to redirect traffic between two routers\
   through his device, gaining access to all packets between those two\
   routers.\
\
   These attacks can be prevented by appropriate security measures, but\
   often these security concerns are overlooked.  It is of the utmost\
   importance that if a shared medium (such as a switch) is used in the\
   above scenarios, that all available layer 2 security mechanisms are\
   used to prevent layer 2 based attacks.\
\
   b) Traffic insertion attacks\
\
   Where many routers share a common layer 2 network (for example, at an\
   Internet exchange point), it is possible for a third party to\
   introduce packets into a network.  This has been abused in the past\
   on traditional exchange points when some service providers have\
   defaulted to another provider on this exchange point.  In effect,\
   they are sending all their traffic into the other SP's network even\
   though the control plane (routing) might not allow that.\
\
   For this reason, routers on exchange points (or other shared layer 2\
   connections) should only accept non-labeled IP packets into the\
   global routing table.  Any labeled packet must be discarded.  This\
   maintains the security of connected networks.\
\
   Some of the above designs require the exchange of labeled packets.\
   This would make it possible for a third party to introduce labeled\
   packets, which if correctly crafted might be associated with certain\
   VPNs on an BGP/MPLS IP VPN network, effectively introducing false\
   packets into a VPN.\
\
\

RFC 4381              Security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs         February 2006\
\
\
   The current recommendation is therefore to discard labeled packets on\
   generic shared-medium layer 2 networks such as Internet exchange\
   points (IXPs).  Where labeled packets need to be exchanged, it is\
   strongly recommended to use private connections.\
\
7.  Summary and Conclusions\
\
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs provide full address and traffic separation as in\
   traditional layer-2 VPN services.  It hides addressing structures of\
   the core and other VPNs, and it is not possible to intrude into other\
   VPNs abusing the BGP/MPLS mechanisms.  It is also impossible to\
   intrude into the MPLS core if this is properly secured.  However,\
   there is a significant difference between BGP/MPLS-based IP VPNs and,\
   for example, FR- or ATM-based VPNs: The control structure of the core\
   is layer 3 in the case of MPLS.  This caused significant skepticism\
   in the industry towards MPLS, since this might open the architecture\
   to DoS attacks from other VPNs or the Internet (if connected).\
\
   As shown in this document, it is possible to secure a BGP/MPLS IP VPN\
   infrastructure to the same level of security as a comparable ATM or\
   FR service.  It is also possible to offer Internet connectivity to\
   MPLS VPNs in a secure manner, and to interconnect different VPNs via\
   firewalls.  Although ATM and FR services have a strong reputation\
   with regard to security, it has been shown that also in these\
   networks security problems can exist [14].\
\
   As far as attacks from within the MPLS core are concerned, all VPN\
   classes (BGP/MPLS, FR, ATM) have the same problem: If an attacker can\
   install a sniffer, he can read information in all VPNs, and if the\
   attacker has access to the core devices, he can execute a large\
   number of attacks, from packet spoofing to introducing new peer\
   routers.  There are a number of precautionary measures outlined above\
   that a service provider can use to tighten security of the core, but\
   the security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture depends on the\
   security of the service provider.  If the service provider is not\
   trusted, the only way to fully secure a VPN against attacks from the\
   "inside" of the VPN service is to run IPsec on top, from the CE\
   devices or beyond.\
\
   This document discussed many aspects of BGP/MPLS IP VPN security.  It\
   has to be noted that the overall security of this architecture\
   depends on all components and is determined by the security of the\
   weakest part of the solution.  For example, a perfectly secured\
   static BGP/MPLS IP VPN network with secured Internet access and\
   secure management is still open to many attacks if there is a weak\
   remote access solution in place.\

1.  Introduction to InfiniBand\
\
   The InfiniBand Trade Association (IBTA) was formed to develop an I/O\
   specification to deliver a channel based, switched fabric technology.\
   The InfiniBand standard is aimed at meeting the requirements of\
   scalability, reliability, availability, and performance of servers in\
   data centers.\
\
1.1.  InfiniBand Architecture Specification\
\
   The InfiniBand Trade Association specification is available for\
   download from http://www.infinibandta.org.\
\
1.2.  Overview of InfiniBand Architecture\
\
   For a more complete overview, the reader is referred to chapter 3 of\
   the InfiniBand specification.\
\
   InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) defines a System Area Network (SAN) for\
   connecting multiple independent processor platforms, I/O platforms,\
   and I/O devices.  The IBA SAN is a communications and management\
   infrastructure supporting both I/O and inter-processor communications\
   for one or more computer systems.\
\
\
\
\
\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
   An IBA SAN consists of processor nodes and I/O units connected\
   through an IBA fabric made up of cascaded switches and IB routers\
   (connecting IB subnets).  I/O units can range in complexity from a\
   single Application-specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) IBA-attached\
   device (such as a LAN adapter) to a large, memory-rich Redundant\
   Array of Independent Disks (RAID) subsystem.\
\
   An IBA network may be subdivided into subnets interconnected by\
   routers.  These are IB routers and IB subnets and not IP routers or\
   IP subnets.  This document will refer to InfiniBand routers and\
   subnets as 'IB routers' and 'IB subnets' respectively.  The IP\
   routers and IP subnets will be referred to as 'routers' and\
   'subnets', respectively.\
\
   Each IB node or switch may attach to a single or multiple switches or\
   directly with each other.  Each IB unit interfaces with the link by\
   way of channel adapters (CAs).  The architecture supports multiple\
   CAs per unit with each CA providing one or more ports that connect to\
   the fabric.  Each CA appears as a node to the fabric.\
\
   The ports are the endpoints to which the data is sent.  However, each\
   of the ports may include multiple QPs (Queue Pairs) that may be\
   directly addressed from a remote peer.  From the point of view of\
   data transfer the QP number (QPN) is part of the address.\
\
   IBA supports both connection-oriented and datagram service between\
   the ports.  The peers are identified by QPN and the port identifier.\
   There are a two exceptions.  QPNs are not used when packets are\
   multicast.  QPNs are also not used in the Raw Datagram mode.\
\
   A port, in a data packet, is identified by a Local Identifier (LID)\
   and optionally a Global Identifier (GID).  The GID in the packet is\
   needed only when communicating across an IB subnet, though it may\
   always be included.\
\
   The GID is 128 bits long and is formed by the concatenation of a 64-\
   bit IB subnet prefix and a 64-bit EUI-64-compliant portion.  The\
   EUI-64 portion of a GID is referred to as the Global Unique\
   Identifier (GUID; EUI stands for Extended Unique Identifier).  The\
   LID is a 16-bit value that is assigned when the port becomes active.\
   The GUID is the only persistent identifier of a port.  However, it\
   cannot be used as an address in a packet.  If the prefix is modified,\
   then the GID may change.  The subnet manager may attempt to keep the\
   LID values constant across reboots, but that is not a requirement.\
\
   The assignment of the GID and the LID is done by the subnet manager.\
   Every IB subnet has at least one subnet manager component that\
   controls the fabric.  It assigns the LIDs and GIDs.  The subnet\

\
\
   manager also programs the switches so that they route packets between\
   destinations.  The subnet manager (SM) and a related component, the\
   subnet administrator (SA), are the central repository of all\
   information that is required to set-up and bring up the fabric.\
\
   IB routers are components that route packets between IB subnets based\
   on the GIDs.  Thus, within an IB subnet a packet may or may not\
   include a GID but when going across an IB subnet the GID must be\
   included.  A LID is always needed in a packet since the destination\
   within a subnet is determined by it.\
\
   A CA and a switch may have multiple ports.  Each CA port is assigned\
   its own LID or a range of LIDs.  The ports of a switch are not\
   addressable by LIDs/GIDs or, in other words, are transparent to other\
   end nodes.  Each port has its own set of buffers.  The buffering is\
   channeled through virtual lanes (VL) where each VL has its own flow\
   control.  There may be up to 16 VLs.\
\
   VLs provide a mechanism for creating multiple virtual links within a\
   single physical link.  All ports must support VL15 which is reserved\
   exclusively for subnet management datagrams and hence does not\
   concern the IP over Infiniband (IPoIB) discussions.  The actual VL\
   that a packet uses is configured by the SM in the switch/channel\
   adapter tables and is determined based on the Service Level (SL)\
   specified in every packet.  There are 16 possible SLs.\
\
   In addition to the features described above viz.  QPs, SLs, and\
   addressing (GID/LID), IBA also defines the following:\
\
   Partitioning:\
\
      Every packet, but for the raw datagrams, carries the partition key\
      (P_Key).  These values are used for isolation in the fabric.  A\
      switch (this is an optional feature) may be programmed by the SM\
      to drop packets not having a certain key.  The CA ports always\
      check for the P_Keys.  A CA port may belong to multiple\
      partitions.  P_Key checking is optional at IB routers.\
\
      A P_Key may be described as having 'limited membership' or 'full\
      membership'.  For a packet to be accepted, at least one of the\
      P_Keys (i.e., the P_Key in the packet or the P_Key in the port)\
      must be 'full membership' P_Keys.\
\
   Q_Keys:\
\
      Q_Keys are used to enforce access rights for reliable and\
      unreliable IB datagram services.  Raw datagram services do not use\
      Q_Keys.  At communication establishment, the endpoints exchange\

\
\
      the Q_Keys and must always use the relevant Q_Keys when\
      communicating with one another.  Multicast packets use the Q_Key\
      associated with the multicast group.\
\
      Q_Keys with the most significant bit set are considered controlled\
      Q_Keys (such as the General Service Interface (GSI) Q_Key\
      [IB_ARCH]) and a Host Channel Adapter (HCA) does not allow a\
      consumer to arbitrarily specify a controlled Q_Key.  An attempt to\
      send a controlled Q_Key results in using the Q_Key in the QP\
      context.  Thus, the Operating System maintains control since it\
      can configure the QP context for the controlled Q_Key for\
      privileged consumers.  It must be noted that though the notion of\
      a 'controlled Q_Key' is suggested by IB specification, it does not\
      require its use or implementation.\
\
   Multicast support:\
\
      A switch may support multicasting, that is, replication of packets\
      across multiple output ports.  This is an optional feature.\
      Similarly, support for sending/receiving multicast packets is\
      optional in CAs.  A multicast group is identified by a GID.  The\
      GID format is as defined in RFC 2373 on IPv6 addressing [IB_ARCH].\
      Thus, from an IPv6-over-InfiniBand point of view, the data link\
      multicast address looks like the network address.  An IB port must\
      explicitly join a multicast group by sending a request to the SM\
      to receive multicast packets.  A port may send packets to any\
      multicast group.  In both cases, the multicast LID to be used in\
      the packets is received from the SM.\
\
   There are six methods for data transfer in IB architecture:\
\
      1.  Unreliable Datagram (unacknowledged - connectionless)\
\
         The Unreliable Datagram (UD) service is connectionless and\
         unacknowledged.  It allows the QP to communicate with any\
         unreliable datagram QP on any node.\
\
         The switches and hence each link can support only a certain\
         MTU.  The MTU ranges are 256 octets, 512 octets, 1024 octets,\
         2048 octets, and 4096 octets.  A UD packet cannot be larger\
         than the link MTU between the two peers.\
\
      2.  Reliable Datagram    (acknowledged - multiplexed)\
\
         The Reliable Datagram (RD) service is multiplexed over\
         connections between nodes called End-to-End Contexts (EEC),\
         which allows each RD QP to communicate with any RD QP on any\
         node with an established EEC.  Multiple QPs can use the same\
\

\
RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
         EEC and a single QP can use multiple EECs (one for each remote\
         node per reliable datagram domain).\
\
      3.  Reliable Connected (acknowledged - connection oriented)\
\
         The Reliable Connected (RC) service associates a local QP with\
         one and only one remote QP.  The message sizes maybe as large\
         as 2^31 octets in length.  The CA implementation takes care of\
         segmentation and assembly.\
\
      4.  Unreliable Connected (unacknowledged - connection oriented)\
\
         The Unreliable Connected (UC) service associates one local QP\
         with one and only one remote QP.  There is no acknowledgement\
         and hence no resend of lost or corrupted packets.  Such packets\
         are therefore simply dropped.  It is similar to RC otherwise.\
\
      5.  Raw Ethertype (unacknowledged - connectionless)\
\
         The Ethertype raw datagram packet contains a generic transport\
         header that is not interpreted by the CA but it specifies the\
         protocol type.  The values for ethertype are the same as\
         defined by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [IANA]\
         for ethertype.\
\
      6.  Raw IPv6 (unacknowledged - connectionless)\
\
         Using IPv6 raw datagram service, the IBA CA can support\
         standard protocol layers atop IPv6 (such as TCP/UDP).  Thus,\
         native IPv6 packets can be bridged into the IBA SAN and\
         delivered directly to a port and to its IPv6 raw datagram QP.\
\
   The first four types are referred to as IB transports.  The latter\
   two are classified as raw datagrams.  There is no indication of the\
   QP number in the raw datagram packets.  The raw datagram packets are\
   limited by the link MTU in size.\
\
   The two connected modes and the Reliable Datagram mode may also\
   support Automatic Path Migration (APM).  This is an optional facility\
   that provides for a hardware based path fail over.  An alternate path\
   is associated with the QP when the connection/EE context is first\
   created.  If unrecoverable errors are encountered, the connection\
   switches to using the alternative path.\
\
1.2.1.  InfiniBand Addresses\
\
   The InfiniBand architecture borrows heavily from the IPv6\
   architecture in terms of the InfiniBand subnet structure and GIDs.\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
   The InfiniBand architecture defines the GID associated with a port as\
   a 128-bit unicast or multicast identifier.  IBA derives the GID\
   address format, as defined in RFC 2373 [IB_ARCH], with some\
   additional properties/restrictions defined to facilitate efficient\
   discovery, communication, and routing.\
\
   Note:  The IBA explicitly refers to RFC 2373, which is obsolete\
      [RFC3513].  It must be noted that IBA is therefore unaffected by\
      any further changes that are introduced in IPv6 addressing\
      architecture.\
\
   IBA defines two types of GIDs: unicast and multicast.\
\
1.2.1.1.  Unicast GIDs\
\
   The unicast GIDs are defined, as in IPv6, with three scopes.  The IB\
   specification states the following:\
\
   a.  link local: FE80/10.\
\
                   The IB routers will not forward packets with a link-\
                   local address in source or destination beyond the IB\
                   subnet.\
\
   b.  site local: FEC0/10\
\
                   A unicast GID used within a collection of subnets\
                   that is unique within that collection (e.g., a data\
                   center or campus) but is not necessarily globally\
                   unique.  IB routers must not forward any packets with\
                   either a site-local Source GID or a site-local\
                   Destination GID outside of the site.\
\
   c.  global:\
\
                   A unicast GID with a global prefix; an IB router may\
                   use this GID to route packets throughout an\
                   enterprise or internet.\

                         Table 1\
\
   The IB specification further refers to RFC 2373 and RFC 2375 while\
   defining the well-known multicast addresses.  However, it then states\
   that the well-known addresses apply to IB raw IPv6 datagrams only.\
   It must be noted though that a multicast group can be associated with\
   only a single Multicast Global Identifier (MGID).  Thus the same MGID\
   cannot be associated with the UD mode and the Raw Datagram mode.\

\
\
1.3.  InfiniBand Multicast Group Management\
\
   IB multicast groups, identified by MGIDs, are managed by the SM.  The\
   SM explicitly programs the IB switches in the fabric to ensure that\
   the packets are received by all the members of the multicast group\
   that request the reception of packets.  The SM also needs to program\
   the switches such that packets transmitted to the group by any group\
   member reach all receivers in the multicast group.\
\
   IBA distinguishes between multicast senders and receivers.  Though\
   all members of a multicast group can transmit to the group (and\
   expect their packets to be correctly forwarded), not all members of\
   the group are receivers.  A port needs to explicitly request that\
   multicast packets addressed to the group be forwarded to it.\
\
   A multicast group is created by sending a join request to the SM.  As\
   will be explained later, IBA defines multiple modes for joining a\
   multicast group.  The subnet manager records the group's multicast\
   GID and the associated characteristics.  The group characteristics\
   are defined by the group path MTU, whether the group will be used for\
   raw datagrams or unreliable datagrams, the service level, the\
   partition key associated with the group, the Local Identifier (LID)\
   associated with the group, and so on.  These characteristics are\
   defined at the time of the group creation.  The interested reader may\
   look up the 'MCMemberRecord' attribute in the IB architecture\
   specification [IB_ARCH] for the complete list of characteristics that\
   define a group.\
\
   A LID is associated with the multicast group by the SM at the time of\
   the multicast group creation.  The SM determines the multicast tree\
   based on all the group members and programs the relevant switches.\
   The Multicast LID (MLID) is used by the switches to route the\
   packets.\
\
   Any member IB port wanting to participate in the multicast group must\
   join the group.  As part of the join operation, the node receives the\
   group characteristics from the SM.  At the same time, the subnet\
   manager ensures that the requester can indeed participate in the\
   group by verifying that it can support the group MTU and its\
   accessibility to the rest of the group members.  Other group\
   characteristics may need verification too.\
\
   The SM, for groups that span IB subnet boundaries, must interact with\
   IB routers to determine the presence of this group in other IB\
   subnets.  If present, the MTU must match across the IB subnets.\
\
\
\
\
\
\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
   P_Key is another characteristic that must match across IB subnets\
   since the P_Key inserted into a packet is not modified by the IB\
   switches or IB routers.  Thus, if the P_Keys did not match the IB\
   router(s) itself might drop the packets or destinations on other\
   subnets might drop the packets.\
\
   A join operation may cause the SM to reprogram the fabric so that the\
   new member can participate in the multicast group.  By the same\
   token, a leave may cause the SM to reprogram the fabric to stop\
   forwarding the packets to the requester.\
\
1.3.1.  Multicast Member Record\
\
   The multicast group is maintained by the SM with each of the group\
   members represented by an MCMemberRecord [IB_ARCH].  Some of its\
   components are the following:\
\
   MGID      - Multicast GID for this multicast group\
   PortGID   - Valid GID of the port joining this multicast group\
   Q_Key     - Q_Key to be used by this multicast group\
   MLID      - Multicast LID for this multicast group\
   MTU       - MTU for this multicast group\
   P_Key     - Partition key for this multicast group\
   SL        - Service level for this multicast group\
   Scope     - Same as MGID address scope\
   JoinState - Join/Leave status requested by the port:\
               bit 0: FullMember\
               bit 1: NonMember\
               bit 2: SendOnlyNonMember\
\
1.3.1.1.  JoinState\
\
   The JoinState indicates the membership qualities a port wishes to add\
   while joining/creating a group or delete when leaving a group.  The\
   meaning of the JoinState bits are as follows:\
\
      FullMember:\
         Messages destined for the group are routed to and from the\
         port.  A group may be deleted by the SM if there are no\
         FullMembers in the group.\
\
      NonMember:\
         Messages destined for the group are routed to and from the\
         port.  The port is not considered a member for purposes of\
         group creation/deletion.\
\
\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
      SendOnlyNonMember:\
         Group messages are only routed from the port but not to the\
         port.  The port is not considered a member for purposes of\
         group creation/deletion.\
\
   A port may have multiple bits set in its record.  In such a case, the\
   membership qualities are a union of the JoinStates.  A port may leave\
   the multicast group for each of the JoinStates individually or in any\
   combination of JoinState bits [IB_ARCH].\
\
1.3.2.  Join and Leave Operations\
\
   An IB port joins a multicast group by sending a join request\
   (SubnAdmSet() method) and leaves a multicast group by sending a leave\
   message (SubnAdmDelete() method) to the SM.  The IBA specification\
   [IB_ARCH] describes the methods and attributes to be used when\
   sending these messages.\
\
1.3.2.1.  Creating a Multicast Group\
\
   There is no 'create' command to form a new multicast group.  The\
   FullMember bit in the JoinState must be set to create a multicast\
   group.  In other words, the first FullMember join request will cause\
   the group to be created as a side effect of the join request.\
   Subsequent join or leave requests may contain any combination of the\
   JoinState bits.\
\
   The creator of the group specifies the Q_Key, MTU, P_Key, SL,\
   FlowLabel, TClass, and the Scope value.  A creator may request that a\
   suitable MGID be created for it.  Alternatively, the request can\
   specify the desired MGID.  In both cases, the MLID is assigned by the\
   SM.\
\
   Thus, a group will be created with the specified values when the\
   requester sets the FullMember bit and no such group already exists in\
   the subnet.\
\
1.3.2.2.  Deleting a Multicast Group\
\
   When the last FullMember leaves the multicast group the SM may delete\
   the multicast group releasing all resources, including those that\
   might exist in the fabric itself, associated with the group.\
\
   Note that a special 'delete' message does not exist.  It is a side\
   effect of the last FullMember 'leave' operation.\

\
\
1.3.2.3.  Multicast Group Create/Delete Traps\
\
   The SA may be requested by the ports to generate a report whenever a\
   multicast group is created or deleted.  The port can specify the\
   multicast group(s) it is interested in by using its MGID or by\
   submitting a wild card request.  The SA will report these events\
   using traps 66 (for creates) and 67 (for deletes)[IB_ARCH].\
\
   Therefore, a port wishing to join a group but not create it by itself\
   may request a create notification or a port might even request a\
   notification for all groups that are created (a wild card request).\
   The SA will diligently inform them of the creation utilizing the\
   aforementioned traps.  The requester can then join the multicast\
   group indicated.  Similarly, a SendOnlyNonMember or a NonMember might\
   request the SA to inform it of group deletions.  The endnode, on\
   receiving a delete report, can safely release the resources\
   associated with the group.  The associated MLID is no longer valid\
   for the group and may be reassigned to a new multicast group by the\
   SM.\
\
2.  Management of InfiniBand Subnet\
\
   To aid in the monitoring and configuration of InfiniBand subnet\
   components, a set of MIB modules needs to be defined.  MIB modules\
   are needed for the channel adapters, InfiniBand interfaces,\
   InfiniBand subnet manager, and InfiniBand subnet management agents\
   and to allow the management of specific device properties.  It must\
   be noted that the management objects addressed in the IPoIB documents\
   are for all of the IB subnet components and are not limited to IP\
   (over IB).  The relevant MIB modules are described in separate\
   documents and are not covered here.\
\
3.  IP over IB\
\
   As described in section 1.0, the InfiniBand architecture provides a\
   broad set of capabilities to choose from when implementing IP over\
   InfiniBand networks.\
\
   The IPoIB specification must not, and does not, require changes in IP\
   and higher-layer protocols.  Nor does it mandate requirements on IP\
   stacks to implement special user-level programs.  It is an aim of\
   IPoIB specification that the IPoIB changes be amenable to\
   modularization and incorporation into existing implementations at the\
   same level as other media types.\

\
\
3.1. InfiniBand as Datalink\
\
   InfiniBand architecture provides multiple methods of data exchange\
   between two endpoints as was noted above.  These are the following:\
\
           Reliable Connected (RC)\
           Reliable Datagram  (RD)\
           Unreliable Connected (UC)\
           Unreliable Datagram (UD)\
           Raw Datagram : Raw IPv6 (R6)\
                        : Raw Ethertype (RE)\
\
   IPoIB can be implemented over any, multiple, or all of these\
   services.  A case can be made for support on any of the transport\
   methods depending on the desired features.\
\
   The IB specification requires Unreliable Datagram mode to be\
   supported by all the IB nodes.  The host channel adapters (HCAs) are\
   specifically required to support Reliable connected (RC) and\
   Unreliable connected (UC) modes but the same is not the case with\
   target channel adapters (TCAs).  Support for the two Raw Datagram\
   modes is entirely optional.  The Raw Datagram mode supports a 16-bit\
   Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) as compared to the better protection\
   provided by the use of a 32-bit CRC in other modes.\
\
   For the sake of simplicity, ease of implementation and integration\
   with existing stacks, it is desirable that the fabric support\
   multicasting.  This is possible only in Unreliable datagram (UD) and\
   IB's Raw datagram modes.\
\
   Thus, it is only the UD mode that is universal, supports multicast,\
   and supports a robust CRC.  Given these conditions it is the obvious\
   choice for IP over InfiniBand [RFC4391].\
\
   Future documents might consider the connected modes.  In contrast to\
   the limited link MTU offered by UD mode, the connected modes can\
   offer significant benefit in terms of performance by utilizing a\
   larger MTU.  Reliability is also enhanced if the underlying feature\
   of automatic path migration of connected modes is utilized.\
\
3.2.  Multicast Support\
\
   InfiniBand specification makes support of multicasting in the\
   switches optional.  Multicast however, is a basic requirement in IP\
   networks.  Therefore, IPoIB requires that multicast-capable\
   InfiniBand fabrics be used to implement IPoIB subnets.\
\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
3.2.1.  Mapping IP Multicast to IB Multicast\
\
   Well-known IP multicast groups are defined for both IPv4 and IPv6\
   [IANA, RFC3513].  Multicast groups may also be dynamically created at\
   any time.  To avoid creating unnecessary duplicates of multicast\
   packets in the fabric, and to avoid unnecessary handling of such\
   packets at the hosts, each of the IP multicast groups needs to be\
   associated with a different IB multicast group as far as possible.  A\
   process is defined in [RFC4391] for mapping the IP multicast\
   addresses to unique IB multicast addresses.\
\
3.2.2.  Transient Flag in IB MGIDs\
\
   The IB specification describes the flag bits as discussed in section\
   1.2.  The IB specification also defines some well-known IB MGIDs.\
   The MGIDs are reserved for the IB's Raw Datagram mode which is\
   incompatible with the other transports of IB.  Any mapping that is\
   defined from IP multicast addresses therefore must not fall into IB's\
   definition of a well-known address.\
\
   Therefore all IPoIB related multicast GIDs always set the transient\
   bit.\
\
3.3.  IP Subnets Across IB Subnets\
\
   Some implementations may wish to support multiple clusters of\
   machines in their own IB subnets but otherwise be part of a common IP\
   subnet.  For such a solution, the IB specification needs multiple\
   upgrades.  Some of the required enhancements are as follows:\
\
   1) A method for creating IB multicast GIDs that span multiple IB\
      subnets.  The partition keys and other parameters need to be\
      consistent across IB subnets.\
\
   2) Develop IB routing protocol to determine the IB topology across IB\
      subnets.\
\
   3) Define the process and protocols needed between IB nodes and IB\
      routers.\
\
   Until the above conditions are met, it is not possible to implement\
   IPoIB subnets that span IB subnets.  The IPoIB standards have\
   however, been defined with this possibility in mind.\
\
4.  IP Subnets in InfiniBand Fabrics\
\
   The IPoIB subnet is overlaid over the IB subnet.  The IPoIB subnet is\
   brought up in the following steps:\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
   Note: the join/leave operation at the IP level will be referred to as\
         IP_join/IP_leave and the join/leave operations at the IB level\
         will be referred to as IB_join in this document.\
\
   1.  The all-IPoIB nodes IB multicast group is created\
\
      The fabric administrator creates an IB multicast group (henceforth\
      called 'broadcast group') when the IP subnet is set up.  The\
      'broadcast group' is defined in [RFC4391].  The method by which\
      the broadcast group is setup is not defined by IPoIB.  The group\
      may be setup at the SM by the administrator or by the first\
      IB_join.\
\
      As noted earlier, at the time of creating an IB multicast group,\
      multiple values such as the P_Key, Q_Key, Service Level, Hop\
      Limit, Flow ID, TClass, MTU, etc.  have to be specified.  These\
      values should be such that all potential members of the IB\
      multicast group are able to communicate with one another when\
      using them.  In the future, as the IB specification associates\
      more meaning with the various parameters and defines IB Quality of\
      Service (QoS), different values for IP multicast traffic may be\
      possible.  All unicast packets also need to use the P_Key and\
      Q_Key specified in the broadcast group [RFC4391].  It is obvious\
      that a thought out configuration is required for a successful\
      setup of the IPoIB subnet.\
\
   2.  All IPoIB interfaces IB_join the broadcast group\
\
      The broadcast group defines the span and the members of the IPoIB\
      link.  This link gets built up as IPoIB nodes IB_join the\
      broadcast group.\
\
      The IB_join to the broadcast group has the additional benefit of\
      distributing the above mentioned multicast group parameters to all\
      the members of the subnet.\
\
      Note that this IB_join to the broadcast group is a FullMember\
      join.  If any of the ports or the switches linking the port to the\
      rest of the IPoIB subnet cannot support the parameters (e.g., path\
      MTU or P_Key) associated with the broadcast group, then the\
      IB_join request will fail and the requesting port will not become\
      part of the IPoIB subnet.\
\
   3.  Configuration Parameters\
\
      As noted above, parameters such as Q_Key and Path MTU, which are\
      needed for all IPoIB communication, are returned to the IPoIB node\
      on IB_joining the 'broadcast group'.  [RFC4391] also notes that\

\
\
      the parameters used in the broadcast group are used when creating\
      other multicast groups.\
\
      However, the P_Key must still be known to the IPoIB endnode before\
      it can join the broadcast group.  The P_Key is included in the\
      mapping of the broadcast group [RFC4391].  Another parameter, the\
      scope of the broadcast group, also needs to be known to the\
      endnode before it can join the broadcast group.  It is an\
      implementation choice on how the P_Key and the scope bits related\
      to the IPoIB subnet are determined by the implementation.  These\
      could be configuration parameters initialized by some means by the\
      administrator.\
\
      The methods employed by an implementation to determine the P_Key\
      and scope bits are not specified by IPoIB.\
\
4.1.  IPoIB VLANs\
\
   The endpoints in an IB subnet must have compatible P_Keys to\
   communicate with one another.  Thus, the administrator when setting\
   up an IP subnet over an IB subnet must ensure that all the members\
   have compatible P_Keys.  An IP subnet can have only one P_Key\
   associated with it to ensure that all IP nodes in it can talk to one\
   another.  An endpoint may, however, have multiple P_Keys.\
\
   The IB architecture specifies that there can be only one MGID\
   associated with a multicast group in the IB subnet.  The P_Key is\
   included in the MGID mappings from the IP multicast addresses\
   [RFC4391].  Since the P_Key is unique in the IB subnet, the inclusion\
   of the P_Key in the IB MGIDs ensures that unique MGID mappings are\
   created.  Every unique broadcast group MGID so formed creates a\
   separate abstract IPoIB link and hence an IPoIB VLAN.\
\
4.2.  Multicast in IPoIB subnets\
\
   IP multicast on InfiniBand subnets follows the same concepts and\
   rules as on any other media.  However, unlike most other media\
   multicast over InfiniBand requires interaction with another entity,\
   the IB subnet manager.  This section describes the outline of the\
   process and suggests some guidelines.\
\
   IB architecture specifies the following format for IB multicast\
   packets when used over Unreliable Datagram (UD) mode:\

   +--------+-------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+\
\
   For details about the various headers please refer to InfiniBand\
   Architecture Specification [IB_ARCH].\
\
   The Global Routing Header (GRH) includes the IB multicast group GID.\
   The Local Routing Header (LRH) includes the Local Identifier (LID).\
   The IB switches in the fabric route the packet based on the LID.\
\
   The GID is made available to the receiving IB user (the IPoIB\
   interface driver for example).  The driver can therefore determine\
   the IB group the packet belongs to.\
\
   IPv4 defines three levels of multicast conformance [RFC1112].\
\
      Level 0: No support for IP multicasting\
\
      Level 1: Support for sending but not receiving multicasts\
\
      Level 2: Full support for IP multicasting\
\
   In IPv6, there is no such distinction.  Full multicast support is\
   mandatory.  In addition, all IPv4 subnets support broadcast\
   (255.255.255.255).  IPv4 broadcast can always be sent/received by all\
   IPv4 interfaces.\
\
   Every IPoIB subnet requires the broadcast GID to be defined.  Thus, a\
   packet can always be broadcast.\
\
4.2.1.  Sending IP Multicast Datagrams\
\
   An IP host may send a multicast packet at any time to any multicast\
   address.\
\
   The IP layer conveys the multicast packet to the IPoIB interface\
   driver/module.  This module attempts to IB_join the relevant IB\
   multicast group.  This is required since otherwise InfiniBand\
   architecture does not guarantee that the packet will reach its\
   destinations.\
\
\
\

\
\
   A pure sender may choose to join the multicast group as a FullMember.\
   In such a case, the sender will receive all the multicast packets\
   transmitted to the IB group.  In addition, the IB group will not be\
   deleted until the sender leaves the group.\
\
   Alternatively, a sender might IB_join as a SendOnlyNonMember.  In\
   such a case, the packets are not routed to the sender though packets\
   transmitted by it can reach the other group members.  In addition,\
   the group can be deleted when all FullMembers have left the group.\
   The sender can further request delete updates from the SM.\
\
   If the sender does not find the group in existence, it is recommended\
   in [RFC4391] that the packets be sent to the MGID corresponding to\
   the all-IP routers address.  A sender could also send the packets to\
   the broadcast group.  The sender might also choose to request\
   'creation' reports from the SM.\
\
4.2.2.  Receiving Multicast Packets\
\
   The IP host must join the IB multicast group corresponding to the IP\
   address.  This follows from the IBA requirement that the receiver\
   must join the relevant IB multicast group.  The group is\
   automatically created if it does not exist [IB_ARCH].\
\
   The IP receivers must IB_leave the IB group when the IP layer stops\
   listening of the corresponding IP address.  The SM can then choose to\
   delete the group.\
\
4.2.3.  Router Considerations for IPoIB\
\
   IP routers know of the new IP groups created in the subnet by the use\
   of protocols such as Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) /\
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC3376, RFC2710].  However, this\
   is not enough for IPoIB since the router needs to IB_join the\
   relevant IB groups to be able to receive and transmit the packets.\
   There is no promiscuous mode for listening to all packets.\
\
   The IPoIB routers therefore need to request the SM to report all\
   creations of IB groups in the fabric.  The IPoIB router can then\
   IB_join the reported group.  It is not desirable that the router's\
   IB_joining of a multicast group be considered the same as the IB_join\
   from a receiver -- the router's IB_join should not disallow the\
   group's deletion when all receivers leave.  To overcome just this\
   type of situation, IBA provides the NonMember IB_join mode.\
\
   The NonMember IB_join mode can be used by IP routers when they join\
   in response to the create reports.  A router should ideally request\
   the delete reports too so that it can release all the resources\
\

\
\
   associated with the group.  The MLID associated with a deleted MGID\
   can be reassigned by the SM, and therefore there is a possibility of\
   erroneous transmissions if the MLID is cached.  A router that does\
   not request delete reports will still work correctly since it will\
   receive the correct MLID , and purge any old cached value, when it\
   IB_joins the IB group in response to a create report.\
\
   It is reasonable for a router to IB_join as a FullMember if it is\
   joining the IB group in response to an application/routing daemon\
   request.  In such a case, the router might end up controlling the\
   existence of the IB group (since it is a FullMember of the group).\
\
4.2.4.  Impact of InfiniBand Architecture Limits\
\
   An HCA or TCA may have a limit on the number of MGIDs it can support.\
   Thus, even though the groups may not be limited at the subnet manager\
   and in the subnet as such, they may be limited at a particular\
   interface.  It is advisable to choose an adequately provisioned\
   HCA/TCA when setting up an IPoIB subnet.\
\
4.2.5.  Leaving/Deleting a Multicast Group\
\
   An IPv4 sender (level 1 compliance) IB_joins the IB multicast group\
   only because that is the only way to guarantee reception of the\
   packets by all the group recipients.  The sender must, however,\
   IB_leave the group at some time.  A sender could, when not a receiver\
   on the group, start a timer per multicast group sent to.  The sender\
   leaves the IB group when the timer goes off.  It restarts the timer\
   if another message is sent.\
\
   This suggestion does not apply to the IB broadcast group.  It also\
   does not apply to the IB group corresponding to the all-hosts\
   multicast group.  An IPv4 host must always remain a member of the\
   broadcast group.\
\
   An IP multicast receiver IB_leaves the corresponding IB multicast\
   group when it IP_leaves the IP multicast group.  In the case of IPv4\
   implementation, the receiver may choose to continue to be a sender\
   (level 1 compliance), in which case it may choose not to IB_leave the\
   IB group but start a timer as explained above.\
\
   As noted elsewhere, the SM can choose to free up the resources (e.g.,\
   routing entries in the switches) associated with the IB group when\
   the last FullMember IB_leaves the group.  The MLID therefore becomes\
   invalid for the group.  The MLID can be reassigned when a new group\
   is created.\
\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
   SendOnlyNonMember/NonMember ports caching the MLID need to avoid this\
   possibility.  The way out is for them to request group delete\
   reports.  An IP router requesting reports for all groups need not\
   request the delete report since an IB_join in response to a create\
   report will return the new MLID association to it.\
\
   A router might prefer to IB_leave the IB multicast group when there\
   are no members of the IP multicast address in the subnet and it has\
   no explicit knowledge of any need to forward such packets.\
\
4.3.  Transmission of IPoIB Packets\
\
   The encapsulation of IP packets in InfiniBand is described in\
   [RFC4391].\
\
   It specifies the use of an 'Ethertype' value [IANA] in all IPoIB\
   communication packets.  The link-layer address is comprised of the\
   GID and the Queue Pair Number (QPN) [RFC4391].\
\
   To enable IPoIB subnets to span across multiple IB-subnets, the\
   specification utilizes the GID as part of the link-layer address.\
   Since all packets in IB have to use the Local Identifier (LID), the\
   address resolution process has the additional step of resolving the\
   destination GID, returned in response to Address Resolution Protocol\
   (ARP) / Neighbor Discover (ND) request, to the LID [RFC4391].  This\
   phase of address resolution might also be used to determine other\
   essential parameters (e.g., the SL, path rate, etc.) for successful\
   IB communication between two peers.\
\
   As noted earlier, all communication in the IPoIB subnet derives the\
   Q_Key to use from the Q_Key specified in the broadcast group.\
\
4.4.  Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) and Static ARP Entries\
\
   RARP entries or static ARP entries are based on invariant link\
   addresses.  In the case of IPoIB, the link address includes the QPN,\
   which might not be constant across reboots or even across network\
   interface resets.  Therefore, static ARP entries or RARP server\
   entries will only work if the implementation(s) using these options\
   can ensure that the QPN associated with an interface is invariant\
   across reboots/network resets [RFC4391].\

RFC 4392                   IPoIB Architecture                 April 2006\
\
\
4.5.  DHCPv4 and IPoIB\
\
   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] utilizes a 'client identifier' field (expected to\
   hold the link-layer address) of 16 octets.  The address in the case\
   of IPoIB is 20 octets.  To get around this problem, IPoIB specifies\
   [RFC4390] that the 'broadcast flag' be used by the client when\
   requesting an IP address.\
\
5.  QoS and Related Issues\
\
   The IB specification suggests the use of service levels for load\
   balancing, QoS, and deadlock avoidance within an IB subnet.  But the\
   IB specification leaves the usage and mode of determination of the SL\
   for the application to decide.  The SL and list of SLs are available\
   in the SA, but it is up to the endnode's application to choose the\
   'right' value.\
\
   Every IPoIB implementation will determine the relevant SL value based\
   on its own policy.  No method or process for choosing the SL has been\
   defined by the IPoIB standards.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document describes the IB architecture as relevant to IPoIB.  It\
   further restates issues specified in other documents.  It does not\
   itself specify any requirements.  There are no security issues\
   introduces by this document.  IPoIB-related security issues are\
   described in [RFC4391] and [RFC4390].\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The InfiniBand specification [IBTA] can be found at\
   http://www.infinibandta.org.  The document [RFC4392] provides a short\
   overview of InfiniBand architecture (IBA) along with considerations\
   for specifying IP over InfiniBand networks.\
\
   IBA defines multiple modes of transport over which IP may be\
   implemented.  The Unreliable Datagram (UD) transport mode best\
   matches the needs of IP and the need for universality as described in\
   [RFC4392].\
\
   This document specifies IPoIB over IB's UD mode.  The implementation\
   of IP subnets over IB's other transport mechanisms is out of scope of\
   this document.\
\
   This document describes the necessary steps required in order to lay\
   out an IP network on top of an IB network.  It describes all the\
   elements of an IPoIB link, how to configure its associated\
   attributes, and how to set up basic broadcast and multicast services\
   for it.\
\
   It further describes IP address resolution and the encapsulation of\
   IP and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets in InfiniBand frame.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\
\
2.  IP over UD Mode\
\
   The unreliable datagram mode of communication is supported by all IB\
   elements be they IB routers, Host Channel Adapters (HCAs), or Target\
   Channel Adapters (TCAs).  In addition to being the only universal\
   transmission method, it supports multicasting, partitioning, and a\

\
\
   32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) [IBTA].  Though multicasting\
   support is optional in IB fabrics, IPoIB architecture requires the\
   participating components to support it.\
\
   All IPoIB implementations MUST support IP over the UD transport mode\
   of IBA.\
\
3.  InfiniBand Datalink\
\
   An IB subnet is formed by a network of IB nodes interconnected either\
   directly or via IB switches.  IB subnets may be connected using IB\
   routers to form a fabric made of multiple IB subnets.  Nodes residing\
   in different IB subnets can communicate directly with one another\
   through IB routers at the IB network layer.  Multiple IP subnets may\
   be overlaid over this IB network.\
\
   An IP subnet is configured over a communication facility or medium\
   over which nodes can communicate at the "link" layer [IPV6].  For\
   example, an ethernet segment is a link formed by interconnected\
   switches/hubs/bridges.  The segment is therefore defined by the\
   physical topology of the network.  This is not the case with IPoIB.\
   IPoIB subnets are built over an abstract "link".  The link is defined\
   by its members and common characteristics such as the P_Key, link\
   MTU, and the Q_Key.\
\
   Any two ports using UD communication mode in an IB fabric can\
   communicate only if they are in the same partition (i.e., have the\
   same P_Key and the same Q_Key) [RFC4392].  The link MTU provides a\
   limit to the size of the payload that may be used.  The packet\
   transmission and routing within the IB fabric are also affected by\
   additional parameters such as the traffic class (TClass), hop limit\
   (HopLimit), service level (SL), and the flow label (FlowLabel)\
   [RFC4392].  The determination and use of these values for IPoIB\
   communication are described in the following sections.\
\
4.  Multicast Mapping\
\
   IB identifies multicast groups by the Multicast Global Identifiers\
   (MGIDs), which follow the same rules as IPv6 multicast addresses.\
   Hence the MGIDs follow the same rules regarding the transient\
   addresses and scope bits albeit in the context of the IB fabric.  The\
   resultant address therefore resembles IPv6 multicast addresses.  The\
   documents [IBTA, RFC4392] give a detailed description of IB\
   multicast.\
\
   The IPoIB multicast mapping is depicted in figure 1.  The same\
   mapping function is used for both IPv4 and IPv6 except for the IPoIB\
   signature field.\

\
   Unless explicitly stated, all addresses and fields in the protocol\
   headers in this document are stored in the network byte order.\
\
   |   8    |  4 |  4 |     16 bits     | 16 bits |      80 bits      |\
   +------ -+----+----+-----------------+---------+-------------------+\

   +--------+----+----+-----------------+---------+-------------------+\
\
                                 Figure 1\
\
   Since an MGID allocated for transporting IP multicast datagrams is\
   considered only a transient link-layer multicast address [RFC4392],\
   all IB MGIDs allocated for IPoIB purpose MUST set T-flag to 1 [IBTA].\
\
   A special signature is embedded to identify the MGID for IPoIB use\
   only.  For IPv4 over IB, the signature MUST be "0x401B".  For IPv6\
   over IB, the signature MUST be "0x601B".\
\
   The IP multicast address is used together with a given IPoIB link\
   P_Key to form the MGID of the IB multicast group.  For IPv6 the lower\
   80-bit of the group ID is used directly in the lower 80-bit of the\
   MGID.  For IPv4, the group ID is only 28-bit long, and is placed\
   directly in the lower 28 bits of the MGID.  The rest of the group ID\
   bits in the MGID are filled with 0.\
\
   E.g., on an IPoIB link that is fully contained within a single IB\
   subnet with a P_Key of 0x8000, the MGIDs for the all-router multicast\
   group with group ID 2 [AARCH, IGMP3] are:\
\
       FF12:401B:8000::2,  for IPv4 in compressed format, and\
       FF12:601B:8000::2,  for IPv6 in compressed format.\
\
   A special case exists for the IPv4 limited broadcast address\
   "255.255.255.255" [HOSTS].  The address SHALL be mapped to the\
   "broadcast-GID", which is defined as follows:\
\
   |   8    |  4 |  4 |     16 bits    | 16 bits | 48 bits  | 32 bits |\
   +--------+----+----+----------------+---------+----------+---------+\

   the corresponding broadcast-GID.\

\
\
4.1.  Broadcast-GID Parameters\
\
   The broadcast-GID is set up with the following attributes:\
\
       1. P_Key\
\
          A "Full Membership" P_Key (high-order bit is set to 1) MUST be\
          used so that all members may communicate with one another.\
\
       2. Q_Key\
\
          It is RECOMMENDED that a controlled Q_Key be used with the\
          high-order bit set.  This is to prevent non-privileged\
          software from fabricating and sending out bogus IP datagrams.\
\
       3. IB MTU\
\
          The value assigned to the broadcast-GID must not be greater\
          than any physical link MTU spanned by the IPoIB subnet.\
\
   The following attributes are required in multicast transmissions and\
   also in unicast transmissions if an IPoIB link covers more than a\
   single IB subnet.\
\
       4. Other parameters\
\
          The selection of TClass, FlowLabel, and HopLimit values is\
          implementation dependent.  But it must take into account the\
          topology of IB subnets comprising the IPoIB link in order to\
          allow successful communication between any two nodes in the\
          same IPoIB link.\
\
          An SL also needs to be assigned to the broadcast-GID.  This SL\
          is used in all multicast communication in the subnet.\
\
          The broadcast-GID's scope bits need to be set based on whether\
          the IPoIB link is confined within an IB subnet or the IPoIB\
          link spans multiple IB subnets.  A default of local-subnet\
          scope (i.e., 0x2) is RECOMMENDED.  A node might determine the\
          scope bits to use by interactively searching for a broadcast-\
          GID of ever greater scope by first starting with the local-\
          scope.  Or, an implementation might include the scope bits as\
          a configuration parameter.\

\
\
5.  Setting Up an IPoIB Link\
\
   The broadcast-GID, as defined in the previous section, MUST be set up\
   for an IPoIB subnet to be formed.  Every IPoIB interface MUST\
   "FullMember" join the IB multicast group defined by the broadcast-\
   GID.  This multicast group will henceforth be referred to as the\
   broadcast group.  The join operation returns the MTU, the Q_Key, and\
   other parameters associated with the broadcast group.  The node then\
   associates the parameters received as a result of the join operation\
   with its IPoIB interface.  The broadcast group also serves to provide\
   a link-layer broadcast service for protocols like ARP, net-directed,\
   subnet-directed, and all-subnets-directed broadcasts in IPv4 over IB\
   networks.\
\
   The join operation is successful only if the Subnet Manager (SM)\
   determines that the joining node can support the MTU registered with\
   the broadcast group [RFC4392] ensuring support for a common link MTU.\
   The SM also ensures that all the nodes joining the broadcast-GID have\
   paths to one another and can therefore send and receive unicast\
   packets.  It further ensures that all the nodes do indeed form a\
   multicast tree that allows packets sent from any member to be\
   replicated to every other member.  Thus, the IPoIB link is formed by\
   the IPoIB nodes joining the broadcast group.  There is no physical\
   demarcation of the IPoIB link other than that determined by the\
   broadcast group membership.\
\
   The P_Key is a configuration parameter that must be known before the\
   broadcast-GID can be formed.  For a node to join a partition, one of\
   its ports must be assigned the relevant P_Key by the SM [RFC4392].\
\
   The method of creation of the broadcast group and the\
   assignment/choice of its parameters are up to the implementation\
   and/or the administrator of the IPoIB subnet.  The broadcast group\
   may be created by the first IPoIB node to be initialized, or it can\
   be created administratively before the IPoIB subnet is set up.  It is\
   RECOMMENDED that the creation and deletion of the broadcast group be\
   under administrative control.\
\
   InfiniBand multicast management, which includes the creation,\
   joining, and leaving of IB multicast groups by IB nodes, is described\
   in [RFC4392].\
\
6.  Frame Format\
\
   All IP and ARP datagrams transported over InfiniBand are prefixed by\
   a 4-octet encapsulation header as illustrated below.\

\
\
   (GRH) [RFC4392] when multicasting or when an InfiniBand packet\
   traverses from one IB subnet to another through an IB router.  Its\
   use is optional when used for unicast transmission between nodes\
   within an IB subnet.  The IPoIB implementation MUST be able to handle\
   packets received with or without the use of GRH.\
\
7.  Maximum Transmission Unit\
\
   IB MTU:  The IB components, that is, IB links, switches, Channel\
      Adapters (CAs), and IB routers, may support maximum payloads of\
      256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 octets.  The maximum IB payload\
      supported by the IB components in any IB path is the IB MTU for\
      the path.\
\
   IPoIB-Link MTU:  The IPoIB-link MTU is the MTU value associated with\
      the broadcast group.  The IPoIB-link MTU can be set to any value\
      up to the smallest IB MTU supported by the IB components\
      comprising the IPoIB link.\
\
   In order to reduce problems with fragmentation and path-MTU\
   discovery, this document requires that all IPoIB implementations\
   support an MTU of 2044 octets, that is, a 2048-octet IPoIB-link MTU\
   minus the 4-octet encapsulation overhead.  Larger and smaller MTUs\
   MAY be supported subject to other existing MTU requirements [IPV6],\
   but the default configuration must support an MTU of 2044 octets.\
\
8.  IPv6 Stateless Autoconfiguration\
\
   IB architecture associates an EUI-64 identifier termed the Globally\
   Unique Identifier (GUID) [RFC4392, IBTA] with each port.  The Local\
   Identifier (LID) is unique within an IB subnet only.\
\
   The interface identifier may be chosen from the following:\
\
      1) The EUI-64-compliant GUID assigned by the manufacturer.\
\
      2) If the IPoIB subnet is fully contained within an IB subnet, any\
         of the unique 16-bit LIDs of the port associated with the IPoIB\
         interface.\
\
         The LID values of a port may change after a reboot/power-cycle\
         of the IB node.  Therefore, if a persistent value is desired,\
         it would be prudent not to use the LID to form the interface\
         identifier.\
\
         On the other hand, the LID provides an identifier that can be\
         used to create a more anonymous IPv6 address since the LID is\
         not globally unique and is subject to change over time.\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that the link-local address be constructed from the\
   port's EUI-64 identifier as given below.\
\
   [AARCH] requires that the interface identifier be created in the\
   "Modified EUI-64" format when derived from an EUI-64 identifier.\
   [IBTA] is unclear if the GUID should use IEEE EUI-64 format or the\
   "Modified EUI-64" format.  Therefore, when creating an interface\
   identifier from the GUID, an implementation MUST do the following:\
\
      => Determine if the GUID is a modified EUI-64 identifier ("u" bit\
      is toggled) as defined by [AARCH]\
\
      => If the GUID is a modified EUI-64 identifier, then the "u" bit\
      MUST NOT be toggled when creating the interface identifier\
\
      => If the GUID is an unmodified EUI-64 identifier, then the "u"\
      bit MUST be toggled in compliance with [AARCH]\
\
8.1.  IPv6 Link-Local Address\
\
   The IPv6 link-local address for an IPoIB interface is formed as\
   described in [AARCH] using the interface identifier as described in\
   the previous section.\
\
9.  Address Mapping - Unicast\
\
   Address resolution in IPv4 subnets is accomplished through Address\
   Resolution Protocol (ARP) [ARP].  It is accomplished in IPv6 subnets\
   using the Neighbor Discovery protocol [DISC].\
\
9.1.  Link Information\
\
   An InfiniBand packet over the UD mode includes multiple headers such\
   as the LRH (local route header), GRH (global route header), BTH (base\
   transport header), DETH (datagram extended transport header) as\
   depicted in figure 4 and specified in the InfiniBand architecture\
   [IBTA].  All these headers comprise the link-layer in an IPoIB link.\
\
   The parameters needed in these IBA headers constitute the link-layer\
   information that needs to be determined before an IP packet may be\
   transmitted across the IPoIB link.\
\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
   The parameters that need to be determined are as follows:\
\
      a) LID\
\
         The LID is always needed.  A packet always includes the LRH\
         that is targeted at the remote node's LID, or an IB router's\
         LID to get to the remote node in another IB subnet.\
\
      b) Global Identifier (GID)\
\
         The GID is not needed when exchanging information within an IB\
         subnet though it may be included in any packet.  It is an\
         absolute necessity when transmitting across the IB subnet since\
         the IB routers use the GID to correctly forward the packets.\
         The source and destination GIDs are fields included in the GRH.\
\
         The GID, if formed using the GUID, can be used to unambiguously\
         identify an endpoint.\
\
      c) Queue Pair Number (QPN)\
\
         Every unicast UD communication is always directed to a\
         particular queue pair (QP) at the peer.\
\
      d) Q_Key\
\
         A Q_Key is associated with each Unreliable Datagram QPN.  The\
         received packets must contain a Q_Key that matches the QP's\
         Q_Key to be accepted.\
\
      e) P_Key\
\
         A successful communication between two IB nodes using UD mode\
         can occur only if the two nodes have compatible P_Keys.  This\
         is referred to as being in the same partition [IBTA].\
\
      f) SL\
\
         Every IBA packet contains an SL value.  A path in IBA is\
         defined by the three-tuple (source LID, destination LID, SL).\
         The SL in turns is mapped to a virtual lane (VL) at every CA,\
         switch that sends/forwards the packet [RFC4392].  Multiple SLs\
         may be used between two endpoints to provide for load\
         balancing.  SLs may be used for providing a Quality of Service\
         (QoS) infrastructure, or may be used to avoid deadlocks in the\
         IBA fabric.\

\
\
   Another auxiliary piece of information, not included in the IBA\
   headers, is the following:\
\
      g) Path rate\
\
         IBA defines multiple link speeds.  A higher-speed transmitter\
         can swamp switches and the CAs.  To avoid such congestion,\
         every source transmitting at greater than 1x speeds is required\
         to determine the "path rate" before the data may be transmitted\
         [IBTA].\
\
9.1.1.  Link-Layer Address/Hardware Address\
\
   Though the list of information required for a successful transmittal\
   of an IPoIB packet is large, not all the information need be\
   determined during the IP address resolution process.\
\
   The 20-octet IPoIB link-layer address used in the source/target\
   link-layer address option in IPv6 and the "hardware address" in\
   IPv4/ARP has the same format.\
\
   The format is as described below:\
\
        0                   1                   2                   3\

\
\
      b) QPN\
\
         Every unicast communication in IB architecture is directed to a\
         specific QP [IBTA].  This QP number is included in the link\
         description.  All IP communication to the relevant IPoIB\
         interface MUST be directed to this QPN.  In the case of IPv4\
         subnets, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) reply packets\
         are also directed to the same QPN.\
\
         The choice of the QPN for IP/ARP communication is up to the\
         implementation.\
\
      c) GID\
\
         This is one of the GIDs of the port associated with the IPoIB\
         interface [IBTA].  IB associates multiple GIDs with a port.  It\
         is RECOMMENDED that the GID formed by the combination of the IB\
         subnet prefix and the port's "Port GUID" [IBTA] be included in\
         the link-layer/hardware address.\
\
9.1.2.  Auxiliary Link Information\
\
   The rest of the parameters are determined as follows:\
\
      a) LID\
\
         The method of determining the peer's LID is not defined in this\
         document.  It is up to the implementation to use any of the\
         IBA-approved methods to determine the destination LID.  One\
         such method is to use the GID determined during the address\
         resolution, to retrieve the associated LID from the IB routing\
         infrastructure or the Subnet Administrator (SA).\
\
         It is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that\
         the IB subnet(s) have unicast connectivity between the IPoIB\
         nodes.  The GID exchanged between two endpoints in a multicast\
         message (ARP/ND) does not guarantee the existence of a unicast\
         path between the two.\
\
         There may be multiple LIDs, and hence paths, between the\
         endpoints.  The criteria for selection of the LIDs are beyond\
         the scope of this document.\

\
\
      b) Q_Key\
\
         The Q_Key received on joining the broadcast group MUST be used\
         for all IPoIB communication over the particular IPoIB link.\
\
      c) P_Key\
\
         The P_Key to be used in the IP subnet is not discovered but is\
         a configuration parameter.\
\
      d) SL\
\
         The method of determining the SL is not defined in this\
         document.  The SL is determined by any of the IBA-approved\
         methods.\
\
      e) Path rate\
\
         The implementation must leverage IB methods to determine the\
         path rate as required.\
\
9.2.  Address Resolution in IPv4 Subnets\
\
   The ARP packet header is as defined in [ARP].  The hardware type is\
   set to 32 (decimal) as specified by IANA [IANA].  The rest of the\
   fields are used as per [ARP].\
\
              16 bits: hardware type\
              16 bits: protocol\
               8 bits: length of hardware address\
               8 bits: length of protocol address\
              16 bits: ARP operation\
\
   The remaining fields in the packet hold the sender/target hardware\
   and protocol addresses.\
\
               [ sender hardware address ]\
               [ sender protocol address ]\
               [ target hardware address ]\
               [ target protocol address ]\
\
   The hardware address included in the ARP packet will be as specified\
   in section 9.1.1 and depicted in figure 5.\
\
   The length of the hardware address used in ARP packet header\
   therefore is 20.\

\
\
9.3.  Address Resolution in IPv6 Subnets\
\
   The Source/Target Link-layer address option is used in Router\
   Solicit, Router advertisements, Redirect, Neighbor Solicitation, and\
   Neighbor Advertisement messages when such messages are transmitted on\
   InfiniBand networks.\
\
   The source/target address option is specified as follows:\
\
       Type:\
           Source Link-layer address       1\
           Target Link-layer address       2\
\
       Length: 3\
\
       Link-layer address:\
\
           The link-layer address is as specified in section 9.1.1 and\
           depicted in figure 5.\
\
           [DISC] specifies the length of source/target option in\
           number of 8-octets as indicated by a length of '3' above.\
           Since the IPoIB link-layer address is only 20 octets long,\
           two octets of zero MUST be prepended to fill the total\
           option length of 24 octets.\
\
9.4.  Cautionary Note on QPN Caching\
\
   The link-layer address for IPoIB includes the QPN, which might not be\
   constant across reboots or even across network interface resets.\
   Cached QPN entries, such as in static ARP entries or in Reverse\
   Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) servers, will only work if the\
   implementation(s) using these options ensure that the QPN associated\
   with an interface is invariant across reboots/network resets.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations revalidate ARP caches\
   periodically due to the aforementioned QPN-induced volatility of\
   IPoIB link-layer addresses.\
\
10.  Sending and Receiving IP Multicast Packets\
\
   Multicast in InfiniBand differs in a number of ways from multicast in\
   ethernet.  This adds some complexity to an IPoIB implementation when\
   supporting IP multicast over IB.\
\
      A) An IB multicast group must be explicitly created through the SA\
         before it can be used.\
\
\
\
\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
         This implies that in order to send a packet destined for an IP\
         multicast address, the IPoIB implementation must check with the\
         SA on the outbound link first for a "MCMemberRecord" that\
         matches the MGID.  If one does exist, the Multicast Local\
         Identifier (MLID) associated with the multicast group is used\
         as the Destination Local Identifier (DLID) for the packet.\
         Otherwise, it implies no member exists on the local link.  If\
         the scope of the IP multicast group is beyond link-local, the\
         packet must be sent to the on-link routers through the use of\
         the all-router multicast group or the broadcast group.  This is\
         to allow local routers to forward the packet to multicast\
         listeners on remote networks.  The all-router multicast group\
         is preferred over the broadcast group for better efficiency.\
         If the all-router multicast group does not exist, the sender\
         can assume that there are no routers on the local link; hence\
         the packet can be safely dropped.\
\
      B) A multicast sender must join the target multicast group before\
         outgoing multicast messages from it can be successfully routed.\
         The "SendOnlyNonMember" join is different from the regular\
         "FullMember" join in two aspects.  First, both types of joins\
         enable multicast packets to be routed FROM the local port, but\
         only the "FullMember" join causes multicast packets to be\
         routed TO the port.  Second, the sender port of a\
         "SendOnlyNonMember" join will not be counted as a member of the\
         multicast group for purposes of group creation and deletion.\
\
   The following code snippet demonstrates the steps in a typical\
   implementation when processing an egress multicast packet.\
\
   if the egress port is already a "SendOnlyNonMember", or a\
   "FullMember"\
       => send the packet\
\
   else if the target multicast group exists\
       => do "SendOnlyNonMember" join\
       => send the packet\
\
   else if scope > link-local AND the all-router multicast group exists\
       => send the packet to all routers\
\
   else\
       => drop the packet\
\
   Implementations should cache the information about the existence of\
   an IB multicast group, its MLID and other attributes.  This is to\
   avoid expensive SA calls on every outgoing multicast packet.  Senders\
   MUST subscribe to the multicast group create and delete traps in\
\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
   order to monitor the status of specific IB multicast groups.  For\
   example, multicast packets directed to the all-router multicast group\
   due to a lack of listener on the local subnet must be forwarded to\
   the right multicast group if the group is created later.  This\
   happens when a listener shows up on the local subnet.\
\
   A node joining an IP multicast group must first construct an MGID\
   according to the rule described in section 4 above.  Once the correct\
   MGID is calculated, the node must call the SA of the outbound link to\
   attempt a "FullMember" join of the IB multicast group corresponding\
   to the MGID.  If the IB multicast group does not already exist, one\
   must be created first with the IPoIB link MTU.  The MGID MUST use the\
   same P_Key, Q_Key, SL, MTU, and HopLimit as those used in the\
   broadcast-GID.  The rest of attributes SHOULD follow the values used\
   in the broadcast-GID as well.\
\
   The join request will cause the local port to be added to the\
   multicast group.  It also enables the SM to program IB switches and\
   routers with the new multicast information to ensure the correct\
   forwarding of multicast packets for the group.\
\
   When a node leaves an IP multicast group, it SHOULD make a\
   "FullMember" leave request to the SA.  This gives the SM an\
   opportunity to update relevant forwarding information, to delete an\
   IB multicast group if the local port is the last FullMember to leave,\
   and to free up the MLID allocated for it.  The specific algorithm is\
   implementation-dependent and is out of the scope of this document.\
\
   Note that for an IPoIB link that spans more than one IB subnet\
   connected by IB routers, an adequate multicast forwarding support at\
   the IB level is required for multicast packets to reach listeners on\
   a remote IB subnet.  The specific mechanism for this is beyond the\
   scope of IPoIB.\
\
11.  IP Multicast Routing\
\
   IP multicast routing requires each interface over which the router is\
   operating to be configured to listen to all link-layer multicast\
   addresses generated by IP [IPMULT, IP6MLD].  For an Ethernet\
   interface, this is often achieved by turning on the promiscuous\
   multicast mode on the interface.\
\
   IBA does not provide any hardware support for promiscuous multicast\
   mode.  Fortunately, a promiscuous multicast mode can be emulated in\
   the software running on a router through the following steps:\
\
      A) Obtain a list of all active IB multicast groups from the local\
         SA.\
\
\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
      B) Make a "NonMember" join request to the SA for every group that\
         has a signature in its MGID matching the one for either IPv4 or\
         IPv6.\
\
      C) Subscribe to the IB multicast group creation events using a\
         wildcarded MGID so that the router can "NonMember" join all IB\
         multicast groups created subsequently for IPv4 or IPv6.\
\
   The "NonMember" join has the same effect as a "FullMember" join\
   except that the former will not be counted as a member of the\
   multicast group for purposes of group creation or deletion.  That is,\
   when the last "FullMember" leaves a multicast group, the group can be\
   safely deleted by the SA without concerning any "NonMember" routers.\
\
12.  New Types of Vulnerability in IB Multicast\
\
   Many IB multicast functions are subject to failures due to a number\
   of possible resource constraints.  These include the creation of IB\
   multicast groups, the join calls ("SendOnlyNonMember", "FullMember",\
   and "NonMember"), and the attaching of a QP to a multicast group.\
\
   In general, the occurrence of these failure conditions is highly\
   implementation-dependent, and is believed to be rare.  Usually, a\
   failed multicast operation at the IB level can be propagated back to\
   the IP level, causing the original operation to fail and the\
   initiator of the operation to be notified.  But some IB multicast\
   functions are not tied to any foreground operation, making their\
   failures hard to detect.  For example, if an IP multicast router\
   attempts to "NonMember" join a newly created multicast group in the\
   local subnet, but the join call fails, packet forwarding for that\
   particular multicast group will likely fail silently, that is,\
   without the attention of local multicast senders.  This type of\
   problem can add more vulnerability to the already unreliable IP\
   multicast operations.\
\
   Implementations SHOULD log error messages upon any failure from an IB\
   multicast operation.  Network administrators should be aware of this\
   vulnerability, and preserve enough multicast resources at the points\
   where IP multicast will be used heavily.  For example, HCAs with\
   ample multicast resources should be used at any IP multicast router.\
\
13.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document specifies IP transmission over a multicast network.\
   Any network of this kind is vulnerable to a sender claiming another's\
   identity and forging traffic or eavesdropping.  It is the\
   responsibility of the higher layers or applications to implement\
   suitable countermeasures if this is a problem.\

RFC 4391               IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)             April 2006\
\
\
   Successful transmission of IP packets depends on the correct setup of\
   the IPoIB link, creation of the broadcast-GID, creation of the QP and\
   its attachment to the broadcast-GID, and the correct determination of\
   various link parameters such as the LID, service level, and path\
   rate.  These operations, many of which involve interactions with the\
   SM/SA, MUST be protected by the underlying operating system.  This is\
   to prevent malicious, non-privileged software from hijacking\
   important resources and configurations.\
\
   Controlled Q_Keys SHOULD be used in all transmissions.  This is to\
   prevent non-privileged software from fabricating IP datagrams.\
\
14.  IANA Considerations\
\
   To support ARP over InfiniBand, a value for the Address Resolution\
   Parameter "Number Hardware Type (hrd)" is required.  IANA has\
   assigned the number "32" to indicate InfiniBand [IANA_ARP].\
\
   Future uses of the reserved bits in the frame format (Figure 3) and\
   link-layer address (Figure 5) MUST be published as RFCs.  This\
   document requires that the reserved bits be set to zero on send and\
   ignored on receive.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Multicast and broadcast communications introduce some new security\
   challenges compared to unicast communication.  Many multicast and\
   broadcast applications need "data origin authentication" (DOA), or\
   "source authentication", in order to guarantee that a received\
   message had originated from a given source, and was not manipulated\
   during the transmission.  In unicast communication, a pairwise\
   security association between one sender and one receiver can provide\
   data origin authentication using symmetric-key cryptography (such as\
   a message authentication code, MAC).  When the communication is\
   strictly pairwise, the sender and receiver agree upon a key that is\
   known only to them.\
\
   In groups, however, a key is shared among more than two members, and\
   this symmetric-key approach does not guarantee data origin\
   authentication.  When there is a group security association [RFC4046]\
   instead of a pairwise security association, any of the members can\
   alter the packet and impersonate any other member.  The MAC in this\
   case only guarantees that the packet was not manipulated by an\
   attacker outside the group (and hence not in possession of the group\
   key), and that the packet was sent by a source within the group.\

RFC 4383                       TESLA-SRTP                  February 2006\
\
\
   Some applications cannot tolerate source ambiguity and need to\
   identify the true sender from any other group member.  A common way\
   to solve the problem is by use of asymmetric cryptography, such as\
   digital signatures.  This method, unfortunately, suffers from high\
   overhead in terms of time (to sign and verify) and bandwidth (to\
   convey the signature in the packet).\
\
   Several schemes have been proposed to provide efficient data origin\
   authentication in multicast and broadcast scenarios.  The Timed\
   Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) is one such\
   scheme.\
\
   This memo specifies TESLA authentication for SRTP.  SRTP TESLA can\
   provide data origin authentication to RTP applications that use group\
   security associations (such as multicast RTP applications) so long as\
   receivers abide by the TESLA security invariants [RFC4082].\
\
1.1.  Notational Conventions\
\
   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with both SRTP\
   and TESLA.  Few of their details are explained in this document, and\
   the reader can find them in their respective specifications,\
   [RFC3711] and [RFC4082].  This specification uses the same\
   definitions as TESLA for common terms and assumes that the reader is\
   familiar with the TESLA algorithms and protocols [RFC4082].\
\
2.  SRTP\
\
   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is a profile\
   of RTP, which can provide confidentiality, message authentication,\
   and replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the RTP control\
   protocol, the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP).  Note that\
   the term "SRTP" may often be used to indicate SRTCP as well.\
\
   SRTP is a framework that allows new security functions and new\
   transforms to be added.  SRTP currently does not define any mechanism\
   to provide data origin authentication for group security\
   associations.  Fortunately, it is straightforward to add TESLA to the\
   SRTP cryptographic framework.\
\
   The TESLA extension to SRTP is defined in this specification, which\
   assumes that the reader is familiar with the SRTP specification\
   [RFC3711], its packet structure, and its processing rules.  TESLA is\

RFC 4383                       TESLA-SRTP                  February 2006\
\
\
   an alternative message-authentication algorithm that authenticates\
   messages from the source when a key is shared among two or more\
   receivers.\
\
3.  TESLA\
\
   TESLA provides delayed per-packet data authentication and is\
   specified in [RFC4082].\
\
   In addition to its SRTP data-packet definition given here, TESLA\
   needs an initial synchronization protocol and initial bootstrapping\
   procedure.  The synchronization protocol allows the sender and the\
   receiver to compare their clocks and determine an upper bound of the\
   difference.  The synchronization protocol is outside the scope of\
   this document.\
\
   TESLA also requires an initial bootstrapping procedure to exchange\
   needed parameters and the initial commitment to the key chain\
   [RFC4082].  For SRTP, it is assumed that the bootstrapping is\
   performed out-of-band, possibly using the key management protocol\
   that is exchanging the security parameters for SRTP, e.g., [RFC3547,\
   RFC3830].  Initial bootstrapping of TESLA is outside the scope of\
   this document.\

\
4.  Usage of TESLA within SRTP\
\
   The present specification is an extension to the SRTP specification\
   [RFC3711] and describes the use of TESLA with only a single key chain\
   and delayed-authentication [RFC4082].\
\
4.1.  The TESLA Extension\
\
   TESLA is an OPTIONAL authentication transform for SRTP.  When used,\
   TESLA adds the fields shown in Figure 1 per-packet.  The fields added\
   by TESLA are called "TESLA authentication extensions," whereas\
   "authentication tag" or "integrity protection tag" indicate the\
   normal SRTP integrity protection tag, when the SRTP master key is\
   shared by more than two endpoints [RFC3711].\

      4.6.  A Section 4.3 parameter establishes the size of this\
      field.\

RFC 4383                       TESLA-SRTP                  February 2006\
\
\
   The "Authenticated Portion" of an SRTP packet consists of the RTP\
   header, the Encrypted Portion of the SRTP packet, and the TESLA\
   authentication extension.  Note that the definition is extended from\
   [RFC3711] by the inclusion of the TESLA authentication extension.\
\
   The "TESLA Authenticated Portion" of an SRTP packet consists of the\
   RTP header and the Encrypted Portion of the SRTP packet.  As shown in\
   Figure 2, the SRTP MAC covers up to the MKI field but does not\
   include the MKI.  It is necessary for packet integrity that the\
   SRTP-TESLA MAC tag be covered by the SRTP integrity check.  SRTP does\
   not cover the MKI field (because it does not need to be covered for\
   SRTP packet integrity).  In order to make the two tags (SRTP-TESLA\
   MAC and SRTP-MAC) contiguous, we would need to redefine the SRTP\
   specification to include the MKI in SRTP-MAC coverage.  This change\
   is impossible, so the MKI field separates the TESLA MAC from the SRTP\
   MAC in the packet layout of Figure 2.  This change to the packet\
   format presents no problem to an implementation that supports the new\
   SRTP-TESLA authentication transform.\
\
   The lengths of the Disclosed Key and TESLA MAC fields are Section 4.3\
   parameters.  As in SRTP, fields that follow the packet payload are\
   not necessarily aligned on 32-bit boundaries.\
\
4.3.  Extension of the SRTP Cryptographic Context\
\
   When TESLA is used, the definition of cryptographic context in\
   Section 3.2 of SRTP SHALL include the following extensions.\
\
   Transform-Dependent Parameters\
\
     1.  an identifier for the PRF (TESLA PRF), implementing the one-way\
         function F(x) in TESLA (to derive the keys in the chain), and\
         the one-way function F'(x) in TESLA (to derive the keys for the\
         TESLA MAC, from the keys in the chain), e.g., to indicate\
         HMAC-SHA1.  See Section 6 for the default value.\
\
     2.  a non-negative integer, n_p, determining the length of the F\
         output; i.e., the length of the keys in the chain (that is also\
         the key disclosed in an SRTP packet).  See Section 6 for the\
         default value.\
\
     3.  a non-negative integer, n_f, determining the length of the\
         output of F', i.e., of the key for the TESLA MAC.  See Section\
         6 for the default value.\
\
     4.  an identifier for the TESLA MAC that accepts the output of\
         F'(x) as its key, e.g., to indicate HMAC-SHA1.  See Section 6\
         for the default value.\

\
\
     5.  a non-negative integer, n_m, determining the length of the\
         output of the TESLA MAC.  See Section 6 for the default value.\
\
     6.  the beginning of the session T_0.\
\
     7.  the interval duration T_int (in msec).\
\
     8.  the key disclosure delay d (in number of intervals).\
\
     9.  the upper bound D_t (in sec) on the lag of the receiver clock\
         relative to the sender clock (this quantity has to be\
         calculated by the peers out-of-band).\
\
     10. a non-negative integer, n_c, determining the length of the key\
         chain, K_0...K_n-1 of [RFC4082] (see also Section 6 of this\
         document), which is determined based upon the expected duration\
         of the stream.\
\
     11. the initial key of the chain to which the sender has committed\
         himself.\
\
   F(x) is used to compute a keychain of keys in SRTP TESLA, as defined\
   in Section 6.  Also according to TESLA, F'(x) computes a TESLA MAC\
   key with inputs as defined in Section 6.\
\
   Section 6 of this document defines the default values for the\
   transform-specific TESLA parameters.\
\
4.4.  SRTP Processing\
\
   The SRTP packet processing is described in Section 3.3 of the SRTP\
   specification [RFC3711].  The use of TESLA slightly changes the\
   processing, as the SRTP MAC is checked upon packet arrival for DoS\
   prevention, but the current packet is not TESLA-authenticated.  Each\
   packet is buffered until a subsequent packet discloses its TESLA key.\
   The TESLA verification itself consists of some steps, such as tests\
   of TESLA security invariants, that are described in Sections 3.5-3.7\
   of [RFC4082].  The words "TESLA computation" and "TESLA verification"\
   hereby imply all those steps, which are not all spelled out in the\
   following.  In particular, notice that the TESLA verification implies\
   checking the safety condition (Section 3.5 of [RFC4082]).\
\
   As pointed out in [RFC4082], if the packet is deemed "unsafe", then\
   the receiver considers the packet unauthenticated.  It should discard\
   unsafe packets, but, at its own risk, it may choose to use them\
   unverified.  Hence, if the safe condition does not hold, it is\
   RECOMMENDED to discard the packet and log the event.\

\
4.4.1.  Sender Processing\
\
   The sender processing is as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3711], up\
   to step 5, inclusive.  After that, the following process is followed:\
\
   6. When TESLA is applied, identify the key in the TESLA chain to be\
      used in the current time interval, and the TESLA MAC key derived\
      from it.  Execute the TESLA computation to obtain the TESLA\
      authentication extension for the current packet, by appending the\
      current interval identifier (as i field), the disclosed key of the\
      chain for the previous disclosure interval (i.e., the key for\
      interval i is disclosed in interval i+d), and the TESLA MAC under\
      the current key from the chain.  This step uses the related TESLA\
      parameters from the crypto context as for Step 4.\
\
   7. If the MKI indicator in the SRTP crypto context is set to one,\
      append the MKI to the packet.\
\
   8. When TESLA is applied, and if the SRTP authentication (external\
      tag) is required (for DoS), compute the authentication tag as\
      described in step 7 of Section 3.3 of the SRTP specification, but\
      with coverage as defined in this specification (see Section 4.6).\
\
   9. If necessary, update the rollover counter (step 8 in Section 3.3\
      of [RFC3711]).\
\
4.4.2.  Receiver Processing\
\
   The receiver processing is as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3711],\
   up to step 4, inclusive.\
\
   To authenticate and replay-protect the current packet, the processing\
   is as follows:\
\
      First, check if the packet has been replayed (as per Section 3.3\
      of [RFC3711]).  Note, however, that the SRTP replay list contains\
      SRTP indices of recently received packets that have been\
      authenticated by TESLA (i.e., replay list updates MUST NOT be\
      based on SRTP MAC).  If the packet is judged to be replayed, then\
      the packet MUST be discarded, and the event SHOULD be logged.\
\
      Next, perform verification of the SRTP integrity protection tag\
      (not the TESLA MAC), if present, using the rollover counter from\
      the current packet, the authentication algorithm indicated in the\
      cryptographic context, and the session authentication key.  If the\
      verification is unsuccessful, the packet MUST be discarded from\
      further processing, and the event SHOULD be logged.\

RFC 4383                       TESLA-SRTP                  February 2006\
\
\
      If the verification is successful, remove and store the MKI (if\
      present) and authentication tag fields from the packet.  The\
      packet is buffered, awaiting disclosure of the TESLA key in a\
      subsequent packet.\
\
      TESLA authentication is performed on a packet when the key is\
      disclosed in a subsequent packet.  Recall that a key for interval\
      i is disclosed during interval i+d, i.e., the same key is\
      disclosed in packets sent over d intervals of length t_int.  If\
      the interval identifier i from the packet (Section 4.1) has\
      advanced more than d intervals from the highest value of i that\
      has been received, then packets have been lost, and one or more\
      keys MUST be computed as described in Section 3.2, second\
      paragraph, of the TESLA specification [RFC4082].  The computation\
      is performed recursively for all disclosed keys that have been\
      lost, from the newly-received interval to the last-received\
      interval.\
\
      When a newly-disclosed key is received or computed, perform the\
      TESLA verification of the packet using the rollover counter from\
      the packet, the TESLA security parameters from the cryptographic\
      context, and the disclosed key.  If the verification is\
      unsuccessful, the packet MUST be discarded from further\
      processing, and the event SHOULD be logged.  If the TESLA\
      verification is successful, remove the TESLA authentication\
      extension from the packet.\
\
   To decrypt the current packet, the processing is as follows:\
\
      Decrypt the Encrypted Portion of the packet, using the decryption\
      algorithm indicated in the cryptographic context, the session\
      encryption key, and salt (if used) found in Step 4 with the index\
      from Step 2.\
\
   (Note that the order of decryption and TESLA verification is not\
   mandated.  It is RECOMMENDED that the TESLA verification be performed\
   before decryption.  TESLA application designers might choose to\
   implement optimistic processing techniques such as notification of\
   TESLA verification results after decryption or even after plaintext\
   processing.  Optimistic verification is beyond the scope of this\
   document.)\
\
   Update the rollover counter and highest sequence number, s_l, in the\
   cryptographic context, using the packet index estimated in Step 2.\
   If replay protection is provided, also update the Replay List (i.e.,\
   the Replay List is updated after the TESLA authentication is\
   successfully verified).\

\
4.5.  SRTCP Packet Format\
\
   Figure 3 illustrates the format of the SRTCP packet when TESLA is\
   applied.  The TESLA authentication extension SHALL be inserted before\
   the MKI and authentication tag.  Recall from [RFC3711] that in SRTCP\
   the MKI is OPTIONAL, while the E-bit, the SRTCP index, and the\
   authentication tag are MANDATORY.  This means that the SRTP\
   (external) MAC is MANDATORY also when TESLA is used.\
\
   As in SRTP, the "Encrypted Portion" of an SRTCP packet consists of\
   the encryption of the RTCP payload of the equivalent compound RTCP\
   packet, from the first RTCP packet, i.e., from the ninth (9) byte to\
   the end of the compound packet.\
\
   The "Authenticated Portion" of an SRTCP packet consists of the entire\
   equivalent (eventually compound) RTCP packet, the E flag, the SRTCP\
   index (after any encryption has been applied to the payload), and the\
   TESLA extension.  Note that the definition is extended from [RFC3711]\
   by the inclusion of the TESLA authentication extension.\
\
   We define the "TESLA Authenticated Portion" of an SRTCP packet as\
   consisting of the RTCP header (first 8 bytes) and the Encrypted\
   Portion of the SRTCP packet.\
\
   Processing of an SRTCP packets is similar to the SRTP processing\
   (Section 4.3), but there are SRTCP-specific changes described in\
   Section 3.4 of the SRTP specification [RFC3711] and in Section 4.6 of\
   this memo.\

\
\
4.6. TESLA MAC\
\
   Let M' denote packet data to be TESLA-authenticated.  In the case of\
   SRTP, M' SHALL consist of the SRTP TESLA Authenticated Portion (RTP\
   header and SRTP Encrypted Portion; see Figure 2) of the packet\
   concatenated with the rollover counter (ROC) of the same packet:\
\
   M' = ROC || TESLA Authenticated Portion.\
\
   In the case of SRTCP, M' SHALL consist of the SRTCP TESLA\
   Authenticated Portion only (RTCP header and SRTCP Encrypted Portion).\
\
   The normal authentication tag (OPTIONAL for SRTP, MANDATORY for\
   SRTCP) SHALL be applied with the same coverage as specified in\
   [RFC3711].  That is:\
\
   - for SRTP: Authenticated Portion || ROC (with the extended\
     definition of SRTP Authentication Portion as in Section 4.2).\
\
   - for SRTCP: Authenticated Portion (with the extended definition of\
     SRTCP Authentication Portion as in Section 4.2).\
\
   The predefined authentication transform in SRTP, HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104],\
   is also used to generate the TESLA MAC.  For SRTP (and respectively\
   for SRTCP), the HMAC SHALL be applied to the key in the TESLA chain\
   corresponding to a particular time interval, and to M' as specified\
   above.  The HMAC output SHALL then be truncated to the n_m left-most\
   bits.  Default values are in Section 6.\
\
   As with SRTP, the predefined HMAC-SHA1 authentication algorithm MAY\
   be replaced with an alternative algorithm that is specified in a\
   future Internet RFC.\
\
4.7.  PRFs\
\
   TESLA requires a pseudo-random function (PRF) to implement\
\
   * one one-way function F(x) to derive the key chain, and\
   * one one-way function F'(x) to derive (from each key of the chain)\
     the key that is actually used to calculate the TESLA MAC.\
\
   When TESLA is used within SRTP, the default choice of the PRF SHALL\
   be HMAC-SHA1.  Default values are in Section 6.\
\
   Other PRFs can be chosen, and their use SHALL follow the common\
   guidelines in [RFC3711] when adding new security parameters.\

\
\
5.  TESLA Bootstrapping and Cleanup\
\
   The extensions to the SRTP cryptographic context include a set of\
   TESLA parameters that are listed in Section 4.3 of this document.\
   Furthermore, TESLA MUST be bootstrapped at session setup (for the\
   parameter exchange and the initial key commitment) through a regular\
   data authentication system (a digital signature algorithm is\
   RECOMMENDED).  Key management procedures can take care of this\
   bootstrapping prior to the commencement of an SRTP session where\
   TESLA authentication is used.  The bootstrapping mechanism is out of\
   scope for this document (it could, for example, be part of the key\
   management protocol).\
\
   A critical factor for the security of TESLA is that the sender and\
   receiver need to be loosely synchronized.  TESLA requires a bound on\
   clock drift to be known (D_t).  Use of TESLA in SRTP assumes that the\
   time synchronization is guaranteed by out-of-band schemes (e.g., key\
   management).  That is, it is not in the scope of SRTP.\
\
   It also should be noted that TESLA has some reliability requirements\
   in that a key is disclosed for a packet in a subsequent packet, which\
   can get lost.  Since a key in a lost packet can be derived from a\
   future packet, TESLA is robust to packet loss.  This key stream\
   stops, however, when the key-bearing data stream packets stop at the\
   conclusion of the RTP session.  To avoid this nasty boundary\
   condition, send null packets with TESLA keys for one entire key-\
   disclosure period following the interval in which the stream ceases:\
   Null packets SHOULD be sent for d intervals of duration t_int (items\
   8 and 9 of Section 4.3).  The rate of null packets SHOULD be the\
   average rate of the session media stream.\
\
6.  SRTP TESLA Default Parameters\
\
   Key management procedures establish SRTP TESLA operating parameters,\
   which are listed in Section 4.3 of this document.  The operating\
   parameters appear in the SRTP cryptographic context and have the\
   default values that are described in this section.  In the future, an\
   Internet RFC MAY define alternative settings for SRTP TESLA that are\
   different than those specified here.  In particular, note that the\
   settings defined in this memo can have a large impact on bandwidth,\
   as they add 38 bytes to each packet (when the field length values are\
   the default ones).  For certain applications, this overhead may\
   represent more than a 50% increase in packet size.  Alternative\
   settings might seek to reduce the number and length of various TESLA\
   fields and outputs.  No such optimizations are considered in this\
   memo.\

\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that the SRTP MAC be truncated to 32 bits, since\
   the SRTP MAC provides only group authentication and serves only as\
   protection against external DoS.\
\
   The default values for the security parameters are listed in the\
   following table.\

   Parameter                        Mandatory-to-support     Default\

   BIT-OUTPUT LENGTH n_p                     160               160\
   BIT-OUTPUT LENGTH n_f                     160               160\

   TESLA MAC                              HMAC-SHA1         HMAC-SHA1\
    (TRUNCATED) BIT-OUTPUT LENGTH n_m         80                80\
\
   As shown above, TESLA implementations MUST support HMAC-SHA1\
   [RFC2104] for the TESLA MAC and the TESLA PRF.  The TESLA keychain\
   generator is recursively defined as follows [RFC4082].\
\
                    K_i=HMAC_SHA1(K_{i+1},0), i=0..N-1\
\
   where N-1=n_c from the cryptographic context.\
\
   The TESLA MAC key generator is defined as follows [RFC4082].\
\
                           K'_i=HMAC_SHA1(K_i,1)\
\
   The TESLA MAC uses a truncated output of ten bytes [RFC2104] and is\
   defined as follows.\
\
                            HMAC_SHA1(K'_i, M')\
\
   where M' is as specified in Section 4.6.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on delayed authentication are\
   discussed in [PCST].  TESLA requires receiver buffering before\
   authentication; therefore, the receiver can suffer a denial of\
   service attack due to a flood of bogus packets.  To address this\
   problem, the external SRTP MAC, based on the group key, MAY be used\
   in addition to the TESLA MAC.  The short size of the SRTP MAC\
   (default 32 bits) is motivated because that MAC is purely for DoS\
   prevention from attackers external to the group.  The shorter output\
   tag means that an attacker has a better chance of getting a forged\
   packet accepted, which is about 2^31 attempts on average.  As a first\
   line of defense against a denial of service attack, a short tag is\
\
\

RFC 4383                       TESLA-SRTP                  February 2006\
\
\
   probably adequate; a victim will likely have ample evidence that it\
   is under attack before accepting a forged packet, which will\
   subsequently fail the TESLA check.  [RFC4082] describes other\
   mechanisms that can be used to prevent DoS, in place of the external\
   group-key MAC.  If used, they need to be added as processing steps\
   (following the guidelines of [RFC4082]).\
\
   The use of TESLA in SRTP defined in this specification is subject to\
   the security considerations discussed in the SRTP specification\
   [RFC3711] and in the TESLA specification [RFC4082].  In particular,\
   the TESLA security is dependent on the computation of the "safety\
   condition" as defined in Section 3.5 of [RFC4082].\
\
   SRTP TESLA depends on the effective security of the systems that\
   perform bootstrapping (time synchronization) and key management.\
   These systems are external to SRTP and are not considered in this\
   specification.\
\
   The length of the TESLA MAC is by default 80 bits.  RFC 2104 requires\
   the MAC length to be at least 80 bits and at least half the output\
   size of the underlying hash function.  The SHA-1 output size is 160\
   bits, so both of these requirements are met with the 80-bit MAC\
   specified in this document.  Note that IPsec implementations tend to\
   use 96 bits for their MAC values to align the header with a 64-bit\
   boundary.  Both MAC sizes are well beyond the reach of current\
   cryptanalytic techniques.\

Abstract\
\
   Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational\
   advantages.  A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple\
   physical links.  There is no need to allocate subnet numbers to the\
   different networks, simplifying management.  Bridging some types of\
   media requires network-layer support, however.  This document\
   describes these cases and specifies the IP-layer support that enables\
   bridging under these circumstances.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   In the IPv4 Internet today, it is common for Network Address\
   Translators (NATs) [NAT] to be used to easily connect one or more\
   leaf links to an existing network without requiring any coordination\
   with the network service provider.  Since NATs modify IP addresses in\
   packets, they are problematic for many IP applications.  As a result,\
   it is desirable to address the problem (for both IPv4 and IPv6)\
   without the need for NATs, while still maintaining the property that\
   no explicit cooperation from the router is needed.\
\
   One common solution is IEEE 802 bridging, as specified in [BRIDGE].\
   It is expected that whenever possible links will be bridged at the\
   link layer using classic bridge technology [BRIDGE] as opposed to\
   using the mechanisms herein.  However, classic bridging at the data-\
   link layer has the following limitations (among others):\
\
   o    It requires the ports to support promiscuous mode.\
\
   o    It requires all ports to support the same type of link-layer\
        addressing (in particular, IEEE 802 addressing).\
\
   As a result, two common scenarios, described below, are not solved,\
   and it is these two scenarios we specifically target in this\
   document.  While the mechanism described herein may apply to other\
   scenarios as well, we will concentrate our discussion on these two\
   scenarios.\
\
1.1.  SCENARIO 1: Wireless Upstream\
\
   The following figure illustrates a likely example:\
\
            |         +-------+           +--------+\
      local |Ethernet |       | Wireless  | Access |\
            +---------+   A   +-)))   (((-+        +--> rest of network\
      hosts |         |       |   link    | Point  |\
            |         +-------+           +--------+\
\
   In this scenario, the access point has assigned an IPv6 subnet prefix\
   to the wireless link, and uses link-layer encryption so that wireless\
   clients may not see each other's data.\
\
   Classic bridging requires the bridge (node A in the above diagram) to\
   be in promiscuous mode.  In this wireless scenario, A cannot put its\
   wireless interface into promiscuous mode, since one wireless node\
   cannot see traffic to/from other wireless nodes.\
\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxying has been used for\
   some years to solve this problem without involving NAT or requiring\
   any change to the access point or router.  In this document, we\
   describe equivalent functionality for IPv6 to remove this incentive\
   to deploy NATs in IPv6.\
\
   We also note that Prefix Delegation [PD] could also be used to solve\
   this scenario.  There are, however, two disadvantages to this.\
   First, if an implementation already supports IPv4 ARP proxying (which\
   is indeed the case in a number of implementations today), then IPv6\
   Prefix Delegation would result in separate IPv6 subnets on either\
   side of the device, while a single IPv4 subnet would span both\
   segments.  This topological discrepancy can complicate applications\
   and protocols that use the concept of a local subnet.  Second, the\
   extent to which Prefix Delegation is supported for any particular\
   subscriber class is up to the service provider.  Hence, there is no\
   guarantee that Prefix Delegation will work without explicit\
   configuration or additional charge.  Bridging, on the other hand,\
   allows the device to work with zero configuration, regardless of the\
   service provider's policies, just as a NAT does.  Hence bridging\
   avoids the incentive to NAT IPv6 just to avoid paying for, or\
   requiring configuration to get, another prefix.\
\
1.2.  SCENARIO 2: PPP Upstream\
\
   The following figure illustrates another likely example:\
\
            |         +-------+           +--------+\
      local |Ethernet |       | PPP link  |        |\
            +---------+   A   +-----------+ Router +--> rest of network\
      hosts |         |       |           |        |\
            |         +-------+           +--------+\
\
   In this scenario, the router has assigned a /64 to the PPP link and\
   advertises it in an IPv6 Router Advertisement.\
\
   Classic bridging does not support non-802 media.  The PPP Bridging\
   Control Protocol [BCP] defines a mechanism for supporting bridging\
   over PPP, but it requires both ends to be configured to support it.\
   Hence IPv4 connectivity is often solved by making the proxy (node A\
   in the above diagram) be a NAT or an IPv4 ARP proxy.  This document\
   specifies a solution for IPv6 that does not involve NAT or require\
   any change to the router.\

\
\
1.3.  Inapplicable Scenarios\
\
   This document is not applicable to scenarios with loops in the\
   physical topology, or where routers exist on multiple segments.\
   These cases are detected and proxying is disabled (see Section 6).\
\
   In addition, this document is not appropriate for scenarios where\
   classic bridging can be applied, or when configuration of the router\
   can be done.\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\
   [KEYWORDS].\
\
   The term "proxy interface" will be used to refer to an interface\
   (which could itself be a bridge interface) over which network-layer\
   proxying is done as defined herein.\
\
   In this document, we make no distinction between a "link" (in the\
   classic IPv6 sense) and a "subnet".  We use the term "segment" to\
   apply to a bridged component of the link.\
\
   Finally, while it is possible that functionality equivalent to that\
   described herein may be achieved by nodes that do not fulfill all the\
   requirements in [NODEREQ], in the remainder of this document we will\
   describe behavior in terms of an IPv6 node as defined in that\
   document.\
\
3.  Requirements\
\
   Proxy behavior is designed with the following requirements in mind:\
\
   o    Support connecting multiple segments with a single subnet\
        prefix.\
\
   o    Support media that cannot be bridged at the link layer.\
\
   o    Do not require any changes to existing routers.  That is,\
        routers on the subnet may be unaware that the subnet is being\
        bridged.\
\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   o    Provide full connectivity between all nodes in the subnet.\
        For example, if there are existing nodes (such as any routers\
        on the subnet) that have addresses in the subnet prefix,\
        adding a proxy must allow bridged nodes to have full\
        connectivity with existing nodes on the subnet.\
\
   o    Prevent loops.\
\
   o    Also work in the absence of any routers.\
\
   o    Support nodes moving between segments.  For example, a node\
        should be able to keep its address without seeing its address\
        as a duplicate due to any cache maintained at the proxy.\
\
   o    Allow dynamic addition of a proxy without adversely\
        disrupting the network.\
\
   o    The proxy behavior should not break any existing classic\
        bridges in use on a network segment.\
\
3.1.  Non-requirements\
\
   The following items are not considered requirements, as they are not\
   met by classic bridges:\
\
   o    Show up as a hop in a traceroute.\
\
   o    Use the shortest path between two nodes on different\
        segments.\
\
   o    Be able to use all available interfaces simultaneously.\
        Instead, bridging technology relies on disabling redundant\
        interfaces to prevent loops.\
\
   o    Support connecting media on which Neighbor Discovery is not\
        possible.  For example, some technologies such as [6TO4] use\
        an algorithmic mapping from IPv6 address to the underlying\
        link-layer (IPv4 in this case) address, and hence cannot\
        support bridging arbitrary IP addresses.\
\
   The following additional items are not considered requirements for\
   this document:\
\
   o    Support network-layer protocols other than IPv6.  We do not\
        preclude such support, but it is not specified in this\
        document.\
\

\
\
   o    Support Redirects for off-subnet destinations that point to a\
        router on a different segment from the redirected host.\
        While this scenario may be desirable, no solution is\
        currently known that does not have undesirable side effects\
        outside the subnet.  As a result, this scenario is outside\
        the scope of this document.\
\
4.  Proxy Behavior\
\
   Network-layer support for proxying between multiple interfaces SHOULD\
   be used only when classic bridging is not possible.\
\
   When a proxy interface comes up, the node puts it in "all-multicast"\
   mode so that it will receive all multicast packets.  It is common for\
   interfaces not to support full promiscuous mode (e.g., on a wireless\
   client), but all-multicast mode is generally still supported.\
\
   As with all other interfaces, IPv6 maintains a neighbor cache for\
   each proxy interface, which will be used as described below.\
\
4.1.  Forwarding Packets\
\
   When a packet from any IPv6 source address other than the unspecified\
   address is received on a proxy interface, the neighbor cache of that\
   interface SHOULD be consulted to find an entry for the source IPv6\
   address.  If no entry exists, one is created in the STALE state.\
\
   When any IPv6 packet is received on a proxy interface, it must be\
   parsed to see whether it is known to be of a type that negotiates\
   link-layer addresses.  This document covers the following types:\
   Neighbor Solicitations, Neighbor Advertisements, Router\
   Advertisements, and Redirects.  These packets are ones that can carry\
   link-layer addresses, and hence must be proxied (as described below)\
   so that packets between nodes on different segments can be received\
   by the proxy and have the correct link-layer address type on each\
   segment.\
\
   When any other IPv6 multicast packet is received on a proxy\
   interface, in addition to any normal IPv6 behavior such as being\
   delivered locally, it is forwarded unchanged (other than using a new\
   link-layer header) out all other proxy interfaces on the same link.\
   (As specified in [BRIDGE], the proxy may instead support multicast\
   learning and filtering, but this is OPTIONAL.)  In particular, the\
   IPv6 Hop Limit is not updated, and no ICMP errors (except as noted in\
   Section 4.1.1 below) are sent as a result of attempting this\
   forwarding.\
\
\
\
\
\
Thaler, et al.                Experimental                      [Page 7]\
\
RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   When any other IPv6 unicast packet is received on a proxy interface,\
   if it is not locally destined then it is forwarded unchanged (other\
   than using a new link-layer header) to the proxy interface for which\
   the next hop address appears in the neighbor cache.  Again the IPv6\
   Hop Limit is not updated, and no ICMP errors (except as noted in\
   Section 4.1.1 below) are sent as a result of attempting this\
   forwarding.  To choose a proxy interface to forward to, the neighbor\
   cache is consulted, and the interface with the neighbor entry in the\
   "best" state is used.  In order of least to most preferred, the\
   states (per [ND]) are INCOMPLETE, STALE, DELAY, PROBE, REACHABLE.  A\
   packet is never forwarded back out the same interface on which it\
   arrived; such a packet is instead silently dropped.\
\
   If no cache entry exists (as may happen if the proxy has previously\
   evicted the cache entry or if the proxy is restarted), the proxy\
   SHOULD queue the packet and initiate Neighbor Discovery as if the\
   packet were being locally generated.  The proxy MAY instead silently\
   drop the packet.  In this case, the entry will eventually be re-\
   created when the sender re-attempts Neighbor Discovery.\
\
   The link-layer header and the link-layer address within the payload\
   for each forwarded packet will be modified as follows:\
\
   1)   The source address will be the address of the outgoing\
        interface.\
\
   2)   The destination address will be the address in the neighbor\
        entry corresponding to the destination IPv6 address.\
\
   3)   The link-layer address within the payload is substituted with\
        the address of the outgoing interface.\
\
4.1.1.  Sending Packet Too Big Messages\
\
   Whenever any IPv6 packet is to be forwarded out an interface whose\
   MTU is smaller than the size of the packet, the ND proxy drops the\
   packet and sends a Packet Too Big message back to the source, as\
   described in [ICMPv6].\
\
4.1.2.  Proxying Packets with Link-Layer Addresses\
\
   Once it is determined that the packet is either multicast or else is\
   not locally destined (if unicast), the special types enumerated above\
   (ARP, etc.) that carry link-layer addresses are handled by generating\
   a proxy packet that contains the proxy's link-layer address on the\
   outgoing interface instead.  Such link-layer addresses occur in the\
\

\
\
   link-layer header itself, as well as in the payloads of some\
   protocols.  As with all forwarded packets, the link-layer header is\

\
   Section 4.1.3 enumerates the currently known cases where link-layer\
   addresses must be changed in payloads.  For guidance on handling\
   future protocols, Section 7, "Guidelines to Proxy Developers",\
   describes the scenarios in which the link-layer address substitution\
   in the payload should be performed.  Note that any change to the\
   length of a proxied packet, such as when the link-layer address\
   length changes, will require a corresponding change to the IPv6\
   Payload Length field.\
\
4.1.3.  IPv6 ND Proxying\
\
   When any IPv6 packet is received on a proxy interface, it must be\
   parsed to see whether it is known to be one of the following types:\
   Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, Router Advertisement,\
   or Redirect.\
\
4.1.3.1.  ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitations\
\
   If the received packet is an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation (NS), the\
   NS is processed locally as described in Section 7.2.3 of [ND] but no\
   NA is generated immediately.  Instead the NS is proxied as described\
   above and the NA will be proxied when it is received.  This ensures\
   that the proxy does not interfere with hosts moving from one segment\
   to another since it never responds to an NS based on its own cache.\
\
4.1.3.2.  ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisements\
\
   If the received packet is an ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement (NA), the\
   neighbor cache on the receiving interface is first updated as if the\
   NA were locally destined, and then the NA is proxied as described in\
   4.1.2 above.\
\
4.1.3.3.  ICMPv6 Router Advertisements\
\
   The following special processing is done for IPv6 Router\
   Advertisements (RAs).\
\
   A new "Proxy" bit is defined in the existing Router Advertisement\
   flags field as follows:\
\
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\
   |M|O|H|Prf|P|Rsv|\
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   where "P" indicates the location of the Proxy bit, and "Rsv"\
   indicates the remaining reserved bits.\
\
   The proxy determines an "upstream" proxy interface, typically through\
   a (zero-configuration) physical choice dictated by the scenario (see\
   Scenarios 1 and 2 above), or through manual configuration.\
\
   When an RA with the P bit clear arrives on the upstream interface,\
   the P bit is set when the RA is proxied out all other ("downstream")\
   proxy interfaces (see Section 6).\
\
   If an RA with the P bit set has arrived on a given interface\
   (including the upstream interface) within the last 60 minutes, that\
   interface MUST NOT be used as a proxy interface; i.e., proxy\
   functionality is disabled on that interface.\
\
   Furthermore, if any RA (regardless of the value of the P bit) has\
   arrived on a "downstream" proxy interface within the last 60 minutes,\
   that interface MUST NOT be used as a proxy interface.\
\
   The RA is processed locally as well as proxied as described in\
   Section 4.1.2, unless such proxying is disabled as noted above.\
\
4.1.3.4.  ICMPv6 Redirects\
\
   If the received packet is an ICMPv6 Redirect message, then the\
   proxied packet should be modified as follows.  If the proxy has a\
   valid (i.e., not INCOMPLETE) neighbor entry for the target address on\
   the same interface as the redirected host, then the Target Link-Layer\
   Address (TLLA) option in the proxied Redirect simply contains the\
   link-layer address of the target as found in the proxy's neighbor\
   entry, since the redirected host may reach the target address\
   directly.  Otherwise, if the proxy has a valid neighbor entry for the\
   target address on some other interface, then the TLLA option in the\
   proxied packet contains the link-layer address of the proxy on the\
   sending interface, since the redirected host must reach the target\
   address through the proxy.  Otherwise, the proxy has no valid\
   neighbor entry for the target address, and the proxied packet\
   contains no TLLA option, which will cause the redirected host to\
   perform Neighbor Discovery for the target address.\
\
4.2.  Originating Packets\
\
   Locally originated packets that are sent on a proxy interface also\
   follow the same rules as packets received on a proxy interface.  If\
   no neighbor entry exists when a unicast packet is to be locally\
   originated, an interface can be chosen in any implementation-specific\
   fashion.  Once the neighbor is resolved, the actual interface will be\

\
\
   discovered and the packet will be sent on that interface.  When a\
   multicast packet is to be locally originated, an interface can be\
   chosen in any implementation-specific fashion, and the packet will\
   then be forwarded out other proxy interfaces on the same link as\
   described in Section 4.1 above.\
\
5.  Example\
\
   Consider the following topology, where A and B are nodes on separate\
   segments which are connected by a proxy P:\
\
        A---|---P---|---B\
         a    p1 p2    b\
\
   A and B have link-layer addresses a and b, respectively.  P has\
   link-layer addresses p1 and p2 on the two segments.  We now walk\
   through the actions that happen when A attempts to send an initial\
   IPv6 packet to B.\
\
   A first does a route lookup on the destination address B.  This\
   matches the on-link subnet prefix, and a destination cache entry is\
   created as well as a neighbor cache entry in the INCOMPLETE state.\
   Before the packet can be sent, A needs to resolve B's link-layer\
   address and sends a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) to the solicited-node\
   multicast address for B.  The Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA) option\
   in the solicitation contains A's link-layer address.\
\
   P receives the solicitation (since it is receiving all link-layer\
   multicast packets) and processes it as it would any multicast packet\
   by forwarding it out to other segments on the link.  However, before\
   actually sending the packet, it determines if the packet being sent\
   is one that requires proxying.  Since it is an NS, it creates a\
   neighbor entry for A on interface 1 and records its link-layer\
   address.  It also creates a neighbor entry for B (on an arbitrary\
   proxy interface) in the INCOMPLETE state.  Since the packet is\
   multicast, P then needs to proxy the NS out all other proxy\
   interfaces on the subnet.  Before sending the packet out interface 2,\
   it replaces the link-layer address in the SLLA option with its own\
   link-layer address, p2.\
\
   B receives this NS, processing it as usual.  Hence it creates a\
   neighbor entry for A mapping it to the link-layer address p2.  It\
   responds with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) sent to A containing B's\
   link-layer address b.  The NA is sent using A's neighbor entry, i.e.,\
   to the link-layer address p2.\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   The NA is received by P, which then processes it as it would any\
   unicast packet; i.e., it forwards this out interface 1, based on the\
   neighbor cache.  However, before actually sending the packet out, it\
   inspects it to determine if the packet being sent is one that\
   requires proxying.  Since it is an NA, it updates its neighbor entry\
   for B to be REACHABLE and records the link-layer address b.  P then\
   replaces the link-layer address in the TLLA option with its own\
   link-layer address on the outgoing interface, p1.  The packet is then\
   sent out interface 1.\
\
   A receives this NA, processing it as usual.  Hence it creates a\
   neighbor entry for B on interface 2 in the REACHABLE state and\
   records the link-layer address p1.\
\
6.  Loop Prevention\
\
   An implementation MUST ensure that loops are prevented by using the P\
   bit in RAs as follows.  The proxy determines an "upstream" proxy\
   interface, typically through a (zero-configuration) physical choice\
   dictated by the scenario (see Scenarios 1 and 2 above), or through\
   manual configuration.  As described in Section 4.1.3.3, only the\
   upstream interface is allowed to receive RAs, and never from other\
   proxies.  Proxy functionality is disabled on an interface otherwise.\
   Finally, a proxy MUST wait until it has sent two P bit RAs on a given\
   "downstream" interface before it enables forwarding on that\
   interface.\
\
7.  Guidelines to Proxy Developers\
\
   Proxy developers will have to accommodate protocols or protocol\
   options (for example, new ICMP messages) that are developed in the\
   future, or protocols that are not mentioned in this document (for\
   example, proprietary protocols).  This section prescribes guidelines\
   that can be used by proxy developers to accommodate protocols that\
   are not mentioned herein.\
\
   1)   If a link-layer address carried in the payload of the\
        protocol can be used in the link-layer header of future\
        messages, then the proxy should substitute it with its own\
        address.  For example, the link-layer address in NA messages is\
        used in the link-layer header for future messages, and,\
        hence, the proxy substitutes it with its own address.\
\
        For multicast packets, the link-layer address substituted\
        within the payload will be different for each outgoing\
        interface.\
\
\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   2)   If the link-layer address in the payload of the protocol will\
        never be used in any link-layer header, then the proxy should\
        not substitute it with its own address.  No special actions\
        are required for supporting these protocols.  For example,\
        [DHCPv6] is in this category.\
\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document defines a new bit in the RA flags (the P bit).  There\
   is currently no registration procedure for such bits, so IANA should\
   not take any action.\
\
9.  Security Considerations\
\
   Unsecured Neighbor Discovery has a number of security issues, which\
   are discussed in detail in [PSREQ].  RFC 3971 [SEND] defines security\
   mechanisms that can protect Neighbor Discovery.\
\
   Proxies are susceptible to the same kind of security issues that\
   plague hosts using unsecured Neighbor Discovery.  These issues\
   include hijacking traffic and denial-of-service within the subnet.\
   Malicious nodes within the subnet can take advantage of this\
   property, and hijack traffic.  In addition, a Neighbor Discovery\
   proxy is essentially a legitimate man-in-the-middle, which implies\
   that there is a need to distinguish proxies from unwanted man-in-\
   the-middle attackers.\
\
   This document does not introduce any new mechanisms for the\
   protection of proxy Neighbor Discovery.  That is, it does not provide\
   a mechanism from authorizing certain devices to act as proxies, and\
   it does not provide extensions to SEND to make it possible to use\
   both SEND and proxies at the same time.  We note that RFC 2461 [ND]\
   already defines the ability to proxy Neighbor Advertisements, and\
   extensions to SEND are already needed to cover that case, independent\
   of this document.\
\
   Note also that the use of proxy Neighbor Discovery may render it\
   impossible to use SEND both on the leaf subnet and on the external\
   subnet.  This is because the modifications performed by the proxy\
   will invalidate the RSA Signature Option in a secured Neighbor\
   Discovery message, and cause SEND-capable nodes to either discard the\
   messages or treat them as unsecured.  The latter is the desired\
   operation when SEND is used together with this specification, and it\
   ensures that SEND nodes within this environment can selectively\
   downgrade themselves to unsecure Neighbor Discovery when proxies are\
   present.\

RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006\
\
\
   In the following, we outline some potential paths to follow when\
   defining a secure proxy mechanism.\
\
   It is reasonable for nodes on the leaf subnet to have a secure\
   relationship with the proxy and to accept ND packets either from the\
   owner of a specific address (normal SEND) or from a trusted proxy\
   that it can verify (see below).\
\
   For nodes on the external subnet, there is a trade-off between\
   security (where all nodes have a secure relationship with the proxy)\
   and privacy (where no nodes are aware that the proxy is a proxy).  In\
   the case of a point-to-point external link (Scenario 2), however,\
   SEND may not be a requirement on that link.\
\
   Verifying that ND packets come from a trusted proxy requires an\
   extension to the SEND protocol and is left for future work [SPND],\
   but is similar to the problem of securing Router Advertisements that\
   is supported today.  For example, a rogue node can send a Router\
   Advertisement to cause a proxy to disable its proxy behavior, and\
   hence cause denial-of-service to other nodes; this threat is covered\
   in Section 4.2.1 of [PSREQ].\
\
   Alternative designs might involve schemes where the right for\
   representing a particular host is delegated to the proxy, or where\
   multiple nodes can make statements on behalf of one address\
   [RINGSIG].\

\
Appendix A: Comparison with Naive RA Proxy\
\
   It has been suggested that a simple Router Advertisement (RA) proxy\
   would be sufficient, where the subnet prefix in an RA is "stolen" by\
   the proxy and applied to a downstream link instead of an upstream\
   link.  Other ND messages are not proxied.\
\
   There are many problems with this approach.  First, it requires\
   cooperation from all nodes on the upstream link.  No node (including\
   the router sending the RA) can have an address in the subnet or it\
   will not have connectivity with nodes on the downstream link.  This\
   is because when a node on a downstream link tries to do Neighbor\
   Discovery, and the proxy does not send the NS on the upstream link,\
   it will never discover the neighbor on the upstream link.  Similarly,\
   if messages are not proxied during Duplicate Address Detection (DAD),\
   conflicts can occur.\
\
   Second, if the proxy assumes that no nodes on the upstream link have\
   addresses in the prefix, such a proxy could not be safely deployed\
   without cooperation from the network administrator since it\
   introduces a requirement that the router itself not have an address\
   in the prefix.  This rules out use in situations where bridges and\
   Network Address Translators (NATs) are used today, which is the\
   problem this document is directly addressing.  Instead, where a\
   prefix is desired for use on one or more downstream links in\
   cooperation with the network administrator, Prefix Delegation [PD]\
   should be used instead.\

Abstract\
\
   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the\
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic Engineering\
   (TE) resources and links.  The GMPLS control plane (routing and\
   signaling) uses TE links for establishing Label Switched Paths\
   (LSPs).  This memo describes the relationship of the LMP procedures\
   to 'discovery' as defined in the International Telecommunication\
   Union (ITU-T), and ongoing ITU-T work.  This document provides an\
   overview of LMP in the context of the ITU-T Automatically Switched\
   Optical Networks (ASON) and transport network terminology and relates\
   it to the ITU-T discovery work to promote a common understanding for\
   progressing the work of IETF and ITU-T.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The GMPLS control plane consists of several building blocks as\
   described in [RFC3945].  The building blocks include signaling,\
   routing, and link management for establishing LSPs.  For scalability\
   purposes, multiple physical resources can be combined to form a\
   single TE link for the purposes of path computation and GMPLS control\
   plane signaling.\
\
   As manual provisioning and management of these links are impractical\
   in large networks, LMP was specified to manage TE links.  Two\
   mandatory management capabilities of LMP are control channel\
   management and TE link property correlation.  Additional optional\
   capabilities include verifying physical connectivity and fault\
   management.  [LMP] defines the messages and procedures for GMPLS TE\
   link management.  [LMP-TEST] defines SONET/SDH-specific messages and\
   procedures for link verification.\
\
   ITU-T Recommendation G.8080 Amendment 1 [G.8080] defines control\
   plane discovery as two separate processes; one process occurs within\
   the transport plane space and the other process occurs within the\
   control plane space.\
\
   The ITU-T has developed Recommendation G.7714, "Generalized automatic\
   discovery techniques" [G.7714], defining the functional processes and\
   information exchange related to transport plane discovery aspects,\
   i.e., layer adjacency discovery and physical media adjacency\
   discovery.  Specific methods and protocols are not defined in\
   Recommendation G.7714.  ITU-T Recommendation G.7714.1, "Protocol for\
   automatic discovery in SDH and OTN networks" [G.7714.1], defines a\

\
   protocol and procedure for transport plane layer adjacency discovery\
   (e.g., discovering the transport plane layer endpoint relationships\
   and verifying their connectivity).  The ITU-T is currently working to\
   extend discovery to control plane aspects providing detail on a\
   discovery framework architecture in G.8080 and a new Recommendation\
   on "Control plane initial establishment, reconfiguration".\
\
2.  ASON Terminology and Abbreviations Related to Discovery\
\
   ITU-T Recommendation G.8080 Amendment 1 [G.8080] and ITU-T\
   Recommendation G.7714 [G.7714] provide definitions and mechanisms\
   related to transport plane discovery.\
\
   Note that in the context of this work, "Transport" relates to the\
   data plane (sometimes called the transport plane or the user plane)\
   and does not refer to the transport layer (layer 4) of the OSI seven\
   layer model, nor to the concept of transport intended by protocols\
   such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\
\
   Special care must be taken with the acronym "TCP", which within the\
   context of the rest of this document means "Termination Connection\
   Point" and does not indicate the Transmission Control Protocol.\
\
2.1.  Terminology\
\
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in [LMP]\
   and [LMP-TEST].  The following ITU-T terminology/abbreviations are\
   used in this document:\
\
   Connection Point (CP): A "reference point" that consists of a pair of\
   co-located "unidirectional connection points" and therefore\
   represents the binding of two paired bidirectional "connections".\
\
   Connection Termination Point (CTP): A connection termination point\
   represents the state of a CP [M.3100].\
\
   Characteristic Information:  Signal with a specific format, which is\
   transferred on "network connections".  The specific formats will be\
   defined in the technology-specific recommendations.  For trails, the\
   Characteristic Information is the payload plus the overhead.  The\
   information transferred is characteristic of the layer network.\
\
   Link: A subset of ports at the edge of a subnetwork or access group\
   that are associated with a corresponding subset of ports at the edge\
   of another subnetwork or access group.\
\
   Link Connection (LC): A transport entity that transfers information\
   between ports across a link.\

RFC 4394             Transport Network View of LMP         February 2006\
\
\
   Network Connection (NC): A concatenation of link and subnetwork\
   connections.\
\
   Subnetwork: A set of ports that are available for the purpose of\
   routing 'characteristic information'.\
\
   Subnetwork Connection (SNC): A flexible connection that is set up and\
   released using management or control plane procedures.\
\
   Subnetwork Point (SNP): SNP is an abstraction that represents an\
   actual or potential underlying connection point (CP) or termination\
   connection point (TCP) for the purpose of control plane\
   representation.\
\
   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that are grouped together\
   for the purpose of routing.\
\
   Termination Connection Point (TCP): A reference point that represents\
   the output of a Trail Termination source function or the input to a\
   Trail Termination sink function.  A network connection represents a\
   transport entity between TCPs.\
\
   Trail Termination source/sink function: A "transport processing\
   function" that accepts the characteristic information of the layer\
   network at its input, removes the information related to "trail"\
   monitoring, and presents the remaining information at its output.\
\
   Unidirectional Connection: A "transport entity" that transfers\
   information transparently from input to output.\
\
   Unidirectional Connection Point: A "reference point" that represents\
   the binding of the output of a "unidirectional connection" to the\
   input of another "unidirectional connection".\

3.  Transport Network Architecture\
\
   A generic functional architecture for transport networks is defined\
   in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation\
   [G.805].  This recommendation describes the functional architecture\
   of transport networks in a technology-independent way.  This\
   architecture forms the basis for a set of technology-specific\
   architectural recommendations for transport networks (e.g., SDH, PDH,\
   OTN, etc.).\
\
   The architecture defined in G.805 is designed using a layered model\
   with a client-server relationship between layers.  The architecture\
   is recursive in nature; a network layer is both a server to the\
   client layer above it and a client to the server layer below it.\
   There are two basic building blocks defined in G.805: "subnetworks"\
   and "links".  A subnetwork is defined as a set of ports that are\
   available for the purpose of routing "characteristic information".  A\
   link consists of a subset of ports at the edge of one subnetwork (or\
   "access group") and is associated with a corresponding subset of\
   ports at the edge of another subnetwork or access group.\
\
   Two types of connections are defined in G.805: link connection (LC)\
   and subnetwork connection (SNC).  A link connection is a fixed and\
   inflexible connection, while a subnetwork connection is flexible and\
   is set up and released using management or control plane procedures.\
   A network connection is defined as a concatenation of subnetwork and\
   link connections.  Figure 1 illustrates link and subnetwork\
   connections.\

\
   G.805 defines a set of reference points for the purpose of\
   identification in both the management and the control planes.  These\
   identifiers are NOT required to be the same.  A link connection or a\
   subnetwork connection is delimited by connection points (CPs).  A\
   network connection is delimited by a termination connection point\
   (TCP).  A link connection in the client layer is represented by a\
   pair of adaptation functions and a trail in the server layer network.\
   A trail represents the transfer of monitored adapted characteristics\
   information of the client layer network between access points (APs).\

\
   For management plane purposes, the G.805 reference points are\
   represented by a set of management objects described in ITU-T\
   Recommendation M.3100 [M.3100].  Connection termination points (CTPs)\
   and trail termination points (TTPs) are the management plane objects\
   for CP and TCP, respectively.\
\
   In the same way as in M.3100, the transport resources in G.805 are\
   identified for the purposes of the control plane by entities suitable\
   for connection control.  G.8080 introduces the reference architecture\
   for the control plane of the Automatically Switched Optical Networks\
   (ASONs).  G.8080 introduces a set of reference points relevant to the\
   ASON control plane and their relationship to the corresponding points\
   in the transport plane.  A subnetwork point (SNP) is an abstraction\
   that represents an actual or potential underlying CP or an actual or\
   potential TCP.  A set of SNPs that are grouped together for the\
   purpose of routing is called SNP pool (SNPP).  Similar to LC and SNC,\
   the SNP-SNP relationship may be static and inflexible (this is\
   referred to as an SNP link connection), or it can be dynamic and\
   flexible (this is referred to as an SNP subnetwork connection).\

\
3.1.  G.8080 Discovery Framework\
\
   G.8080 provides a reference control plane architecture based on the\
   descriptive use of functional components representing abstract\
   entities and abstract component interfaces.  The description is\
   generic, and no particular physical partitioning of functions is\
   implied.  The input/output information flows associated with the\
   functional components serve for defining the functions of the\
   components and are considered to be conceptual, not physical.\
   Components can be combined in different ways, and the description is\
   not intended to limit implementations.  Control plane discovery is\
   described in G.8080 by using three components: Discovery Agent (DA),\
   Termination and Adaptation Performer (TAP), and Link Resource Manager\
   (LRM).\
\
   The objective of the discovery framework in G.8080 is to establish\
   the relationship between CP-CP link connections (transport plane) and\
   SNP-SNP link connections (control plane).  The fundamental\
   characteristics of G.8080 discovery framework is the functional\
   separation between the control and the transport plane discovery\
   processes and name spaces.  From G.8080: "This separation allows\
   control plane names to be completely separate from transport plane\
   names, and completely independent of the method used to populate the\
   DAs with those transport names.  In order to assign an SNP-SNP link\
   connection to an SNPP link, it is only necessary for the transport\
   name for the link connection to exist".  Thus, it is possible to\
   assign link connections to the control plane without the link\
   connection being physically connected.\
\
   Discovery encompasses two separate processes: (1) transport plane\
   discovery, i.e., CP-to-CP and TCP-to-TCP connectivity; and (2)\
   control plane discovery, i.e., SNP-to-SNP and SNPP links.\
\
   G.8080 Amendment 1 defines the Discovery Agent (DA) as the entity\
   responsible for discovery in the transport plane.  The DA operates in\
   the transport name space only and in cooperation with the Termination\
   and Adaptation Performer (TAP), provides the separation between that\
   space and the control plane names.  A local DA is only aware of the\
   CPs and TCPs that are assigned to it.  The DA holds the CP-CP link\
   connection in the transport plane to enable SNP-SNP link connections\
   to be bound to them at a later time by the TAP.  The CP-CP\
   relationship may be discovered (e.g., per G.7714.1) or provided by a\
   management system.\
\
   Control plane discovery takes place entirely within the control plane\
   name space (SNPs).  The Link Resource Manager (LRM) holds the SNP-SNP\
   binding information necessary for the control plane name of the link\
   connection, while the termination adaptation performer (TAP) holds\

4.  Discovery Technologies\
\
4.1.  Generalized Automatic Discovery Techniques G.7714\
\
   Generalized automatic discovery techniques are described in G.7714 to\
   aid resource management and routing for G.8080.  The term routing\
   here is described in the transport context of routing connections in\
   an optical network as opposed to the routing context typically\
   associated in packet networks.\
\
   G.7714 is concerned with two types of discovery:\
\
   - Layer adjacency discovery\
   - Physical media adjacency discovery\
\
   Layer adjacency discovery can be used to correlate physical\
   connections with management configured attributes.  Among other\
   features this capability allows reduction in configuration and the\
   detection of mis-wired equipment.\
\
   Physical media adjacency discovery is a process that allows the\
   physical testing of the media for the purpose of inventory capacity\
   and verifying the port characteristics of physical media adjacent\
   networks.\
\
   G.7714 does not specify specific protocols but rather the type of\
   techniques that can be used.  G.7714.1 specifies a protocol for layer\
   adjacency with respect to SDH and OTN networks for layer adjacency\
   discovery.  A GMPLS method for layer discovery using elements of LMP\
   is included in this set of procedures.\
\
   An important point about the G.7714 specification is that it\
   specifies a discovery mechanism for optical networks but not\
   necessarily how the information will be used.  It is intended that\
   the transport management plane or a transport control plane may\

4.2.  LMP and G.8080 Terminology Mapping\
\
   GMPLS is a set of IP-based protocols, including LMP, providing a\
   control plane for multiple data plane technologies, including\
   optical/transport networks and their resources (i.e., wavelengths,\
   timeslots, etc.) and without assuming any restriction on the control\
   plane architecture (see [RFC3945]).  On the other hand, G.8080\
   defines a control plane reference architecture for optical/transport\
   networks without any restriction on the control plane implementation.\
   Being developed in separate standards forums, and with different\
   scopes, they use different terms and definitions.\

\
\
   Terminology mapping between LMP and ASON (G.805/G.8080) is an\
   important step towards the understanding of the two architectures and\
   allows for potential cooperation in areas where cooperation is\
   possible.  To facilitate this mapping, we differentiate between the\
   two types of data links in LMP.  According to LMP, a data link may be\
   considered by each node that it terminates on as either a 'port' or a\
   'component link'.  The LMP notions of port and component link are\
   supported by the G.805/G.8080 architecture.  G.8080's variable\
   adaptation function is broadly equivalent to LMP's component link,\
   i.e., a single server-layer trail dynamically supporting different\
   multiplexing structures.  Note that when the data plane delivers its\
   own addressing space, LMP Interface_IDs and Data Links IDs are used\
   as handles by the control plane to the actual CP Name and CP-to-CP\
   Name, respectively.\
\
   The terminology mapping is summarized in the following table: Note\
   that the table maps ASON terms to GMPLS terms that refer to\
   equivalent objects, but in many cases there is not a one-to-one\
   mapping.  Additional information beyond discovery terminology can be\
   found in [LEXICO].\

   where composite identifiers are:\

   - Data Link ID: <Local Interface ID; Remote Interface ID>\
   - TE Link ID:   <Local Link ID; Remote Link ID>\
\
   Composite Identifiers are defined in the RFC 4204 [LMP].  LMP\
   discovers data links and identifies them by the pair of local and\
   remote interface IDs.  TE links are composed of data links or\
   component TE links.  TE links are similarly identified by pair of\
   local and remote link ID.\

\
\
4.2.1.  TE Link Definition and Scope\
\
   In the table, TE link/resource is equated with the concept of SNP,\
   SNP LC, SNPP, and SNPP link.  The definition of the TE link is broad\
   in scope, and it is useful to repeat it here.  The original\
   definition appears in [GMPLS-RTG]:\
\
   "A TE link is a logical construct that represents a way to group/map\
   the information about certain physical resources (and their\
   properties) that interconnects LSRs into the information that is used\
   by Constrained SPF for GMPLS path computation, and GMPLS signaling".\
\
   While this definition is concise, it is probably worth pointing out\
   some of the implications of the definition.\
\
   A component of the TE link may follow different paths between the\
   pair of LSRs.  For example, a TE link comprising multiple STS-3cs,\
   the individual STS-3cs component links may take identical or\
   different physical (OC-3 and/or OC-48) paths between LSRs.\
\
   The TE link construct is a logical construction encompassing many\
   layers in networks [RFC3471].  A TE link can represent either\
   unallocated potential or allocated actual resources.  Further\
   allocation is represented by bandwidth reservation, and the resources\
   may be real or, in the case of packets, virtual to allow for\
   overbooking or other forms of statistical multiplexing schemes.\
\
   Since TE links may represent large numbers of parallel resources,\
   they can be bundled for efficient summarization of resource capacity.\
   Typically, bundling represents a logical TE link resource at a\
   particular Interface Switching Capability.  Once TE link resources\
   are allocated, the actual capacity may be represented as LSP\
   hierarchical (tunneled) TE link capability in another logical TE link\
   [HIER].\
\
   TE links also incorporate the notion of a Forwarding Adjacency (FA)\
   and Interface Switching Capability [RFC3945].  The FA allows\
   transport resources to be represented as TE links.  The Interface\
   Switching Capability specifies the type of transport capability such\
   as Packet Switch Capable (PSC), Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-\
   Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC), and Fiber-\
   Switch Capable (FSC).\
\
   A TE link between GMPLS-controlled optical nodes may consist of a\
   bundled TE link, which itself consists of a mix of point-to-point\
   component links [BUNDLE].  A TE link is identified by the tuple (link\
   Identifier (32-bit number), Component link Identifier (32-bit\
   number), and generalized label (media specific)).\

\
\
4.3.  LMP and G.8080 Discovery Relationship\
\
   LMP currently consists of four primary procedures, of which the first\
   two are mandatory and the last two are optional:\
\
         1.  Control channel management\
         2.  Link property correlation\
         3.  Link verification\
         4.  Fault management\
\
   LMP procedures that are relevant to G.8080 control plane discovery\
   are control channel management, link property correlation, and link\
   verification.  Key to understanding G.8080 discovery aspects in\
   relation to [LMP] is that LMP procedures are specific for an IP-based\
   control plane abstraction of the transport plane.\
\
   LMP control channel management is used to establish and maintain\
   control channel connectivity between LMP adjacent nodes.  In GMPLS,\
   the control channels between two adjacent nodes are not required to\
   use the same physical medium as the TE links between those nodes.\
   The control channels that are used to exchange the GMPLS control\
   plane information exist independently of the TE links they manage\
   (i.e., control channels may be in-band or out-of-band, provided the\
   associated control points terminate the LMP packets).  The Link\
   Management Protocol [LMP] was designed to manage TE links,\
   independently of the physical medium capabilities of the data links.\
\
   Link property correlation is used to aggregate multiple data links\
   into a single TE link and to synchronize the link properties.\
\
   Link verification is used to verify the physical connectivity of the\
   data links and verify the mapping of the Interface-ID to Link-ID (CP\
   to SNP).  The local-to-remote associations can be obtained using a\
   priori knowledge or using the link verification procedure.\
\
   Fault management is primarily used to suppress alarms and to localize\
   failures.  It is an optional LMP procedure; its use will depend on\
   the specific technology's capabilities.\
\
   [LMP] supports distinct transport and control plane name spaces with\
   the (out-of-band) TRACE object (see [LMP-TEST]).  The LMP TRACE\
   object allows transport plane names to be associated with interface\
   identifiers [LMP-TEST].\
\
   Aspects of LMP link verification appear similar to G.7714.1\
   discovery; however, the two procedures are different.  G.7714.1\
   provides discovery of the transport plane layer adjacencies.  It\
   provides a generic procedure to discover the connectivity of two\

\
\
   endpoints in the transport plane.  On the other hand, the LMP link\
   verification procedure is a control-plane-driven procedure and\
   assumes either (1) a priori knowledge of the associated data plane's\
   local and remote endpoint connectivity and Interface_IDs (e.g., via\
   management plane or use of G.7714.1), or (2) support of the remote\
   node for associating the data interface being verified with the\
   content of the TRACE object (inferred mapping).  For SONET/SDH\
   transport networks, LMP verification uses the SONET/SDH Trail Trace\
   identifier (see [G.783]).\
\
   G.7714.1 supports the use of transport plane discovery independent of\
   the platform using the capability.  Furthermore, G.7714.1 specifies\
   the use of a Discovery Agent that could be located in an external\
   system and the need to support the use of text-oriented man-machine\
   language to provide the interface.  Therefore, G.7714.1 limits the\
   discovery messages to printable characters defined by [T.50] and\
   requires Base64 encoding for the TCP-ID and DA ID.  External name-\
   servers may be used to resolve the G.7714.1 TCP name, allowing the\
   TCP to have an IP, Network Service Access Protocol (NSAP), or any\
   other address format.  On the other hand, LMP is based on the use of\
   an IP-based control plane, and the LMP interface ID uses IPv4, IPv6,\
   or unnumbered interface IDs.\
\
4.4.  Comparing LMP and G.8080\
\
   LMP exists to support GMPLS TE resource and TE link discovery.  In\
   section 4.2.1, we elaborated on the definition of the TE link.  LMP\
   enables the aspects of TE links to be discovered and reported to the\
   control plane, more specifically, the routing plane.  G.8080 and\
   G.7714 are agnostic to the type of control plane and discovery\
   protocol used.  LMP is a valid realization of a control plane\
   discovery process under a G.8080 model.\
\
   G.7714 specifies transport plane discovery with respect to the\
   transport layer CTPs or TCPs using ASON conventions and naming for\
   the elements of the ASON control plane and the ASON management plane.\
   This discovery supports a centralized management model of\
   configuration as well as a distributed control plane model; in other\
   words, discovered items can be reported to the management plane or\
   the control plane.  G.7714.1 provides one realization of a transport\
   plane discovery process.\
\
   Today, LMP and G.7714, G7714.1 are defined in different standards\
   organizations.  They have evolved out of different naming schemes and\
   architectural concepts.  Whereas G.7714.1 supports a transport plane\
   layer adjacency connectivity verification that can be used by a\

   the transport plane connections).\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   Since this document is purely descriptive in nature, it does not\
   introduce any security issues.\
\
   G.8080 and G.7714/G.7714.1 provide security as associated with the\
   Data Communications Network on which they are implemented.\
\
   LMP is specified using IP, which provides security mechanisms\
   associated with the IP network on which it is implemented.\

RFC 4377           OAM Requirements for MPLS Networks      February 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document describes requirements for user and data plane\
   Operations and Management (OAM) for Multi-Protocol Label Switching\
   (MPLS).  These requirements have been gathered from network operators\
   who have extensive experience deploying MPLS networks.  This document\
   specifies OAM requirements for MPLS, as well as for applications of\
   MPLS.\
\
   Currently, there are no specific mechanisms proposed to address these\
   requirements.  The goal of this document is to identify a commonly\
   applicable set of requirements for MPLS OAM at this time.\
   Specifically, a set of requirements that apply to the most common set\
   of MPLS networks deployed by service provider organizations at the\
   time this document was written.  These requirements can then be used\
   as a base for network management tool development and to guide the\
   evolution of currently specified tools, as well as the specification\
   of OAM functions that are intrinsic to protocols used in MPLS\
   networks.\

\
2.1.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\
\
   Queuing/buffering Latency: The delay caused by packet queuing (value\
                              is variable since it is dependent on the\
                              packet arrival rate, the packet length,\
                              and the link throughput).\
\
   Probe-based-detection:     Active measurement tool that can measure\
                              the consistency of an LSP [RFC4379].\
\
   Defect:                    Any error condition that prevents a Label\
                              Switched Path (LSP) from functioning\
                              correctly.  For example, loss of an\
                              Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) path will\
                              most likely result in an LSP not being\
                              able to deliver traffic to its\
                              destination.  Another example is the\
                              interruption of the path for a TE tunnel.\
                              These may be due to physical circuit\
                              failures or failure of switching nodes to\
                              operate as expected.\

                              definitions of defects (when it is broken\
                              and when it is not) such that both\

\
   Head-end Label Switching\
   Router (LSR):              The beginning of an LSP.  A head-end LSR\
                              is also referred to as an ingress LSR.\
\
   Tail-end Label Switching\
   Router (LSR):              The end of an LSP.  A tail-end LSR is also\
                              referred to as an egress LSR.\
\
   Propagation Latency:       The delay added by the propagation of the\
                              packet through the link (fixed value that\
                              depends on the distance of the link and\
                              the propagation speed).\
\
   Transmission Latency:      The delay added by the transmission of the\
                              packet over the link, i.e., the time it\
                              takes to put the packet over the media\
                              (value that depends on the link throughput\
                              and packet length).\
\
   Processing Latency:        The delay added by all the operations\
                              related to the switching of labeled\
                              packets (value is node implementation\
                              specific and may be considered fixed and\
                              constant for a given type of equipment).\
\
   Node Latency:              The delay added by the network element\
                              resulting from of the sum of the\
                              transmission, processing, and\
                              queuing/buffering latency.\
\
   One-hop Delay:             The fixed delay experienced by a packet to\
                              reach the next hop resulting from the of\
                              the propagation latency, the transmission\
                              latency, and the processing latency.\
\
   Minimum Path Latency:      The sum of the one-hop delays experienced\
                              by the packet when traveling from the\

3.  Motivations\
\
   This document was created to provide requirements that could be used\
   to create consistent and useful OAM functionality that meets\
   operational requirements of those service providers (SPs) who have\
   deployed or are deploying MPLS.\
\
4.  Requirements\
\
   The following sections enumerate the OAM requirements gathered from\
   service providers who have deployed MPLS and services based on MPLS\
   networks.  Each requirement is specified in detail to clarify its\
   applicability.  Although the requirements specified herein are\
   defined by the IETF, they have been made consistent with requirements\
   gathered by other standards bodies such as the ITU [Y1710].\

RFC 4377           OAM Requirements for MPLS Networks      February 2006\
\
\
4.1.  Detection of Label Switched Path Defects\
\
   The ability to detect defects in a broken LSP MUST not require manual\
   hop-by-hop troubleshooting of each LSR used to switch traffic for\
   that LSP.  For example, it is not desirable to manually visit each\
   LSR along the data plane path transited by an LSP; instead, this\
   function MUST be automated and able to be performed at some operator\
   specified frequency from the origination point of that LSP.  This\
   implies solutions that are interoperable to allow for such automatic\
   operation.\
\
   Furthermore, the automation of path liveliness is desired in cases\
   where large numbers of LSPs might be tested.  For example, automated\
   ingress LSR to egress LSR testing functionality is desired for some\
   LSPs.  The goal is to detect LSP path defects before customers do,\
   which requires detection and correction of LSP defects in a manner\
   that is both predictable and within the constraints of the service\
   level agreement under which the service is being offered.  Simply\
   put, the sum of the time it takes an OAM tool to detect a defect and\
   the time needed for an operational support system to react to this\
   defect, by possibly correcting it or notifying the customer, must\
   fall within the bounds of the service level agreement in question.\
\
   Synchronization of detection time bounds by tools used to detect\
   broken LSPs is required.  Failure to specify defect detection time\
   bounds may result in an ambiguity in test results.  If the time to\
   detect broken LSPs is known, then automated responses can be\
   specified with respect and regard to resiliency and service level\
   specification reporting.  Further, if synchronization of detection\
   time bounds is possible, an operational framework can be established\
   to guide the design and specification of MPLS applications.\
\
   Although an ICMP-based ping [RFC792] can be sent through an LSP as an\
   IP payload, the use of this tool to verify the defect-free operation\
   of an LSP has the potential of returning erroneous results (both\
   positive and negative) for a number of reasons.  For example, in some\
   cases, because the ICMP traffic is based on legally addressable IP\
   addressing, it is possible for ICMP messages that are originally\
   transmitted inside of an LSP to "fall out of the LSP" at some point\
   along the path.  In these cases, since ICMP packets are routable, a\
   falsely positive response may be returned.  In other cases, where the\
   data plane of a specific LSP needs to be tested, it is difficult to\
   guarantee that traffic based on an ICMP ping header is parsed and\
   hashed to the same equal-cost multi-paths (ECMP) as the data traffic.\
\
   Any detection mechanisms that depend on receiving the status via a\
   return path SHOULD provide multiple return options with the\
   expectation that one of them will not be impacted by the original\

\
\
   defect.  An example of a case where a false negative might occur\
   would be a mechanism that requires a functional MPLS return path.\
   Since MPLS LSPs are unidirectional, it is possible that although the\
   forward LSP, which is the LSP under test, might be functioning, the\
   response from the destination LSR might be lost, thus giving the\
   source LSR the false impression that the forward LSP is defective.\
   However, if an alternate return path could be specified -- say IP for\
   example -- then the source could specify this as the return path to\
   the destination, and in this case, would receive a response\
   indicating that the return LSP is defective.\
\
   The OAM packet MUST follow the customer data path exactly in order to\
   reflect path liveliness used by customer data.  Particular cases of\
   interest are forwarding mechanisms, such as ECMP scenarios within the\
   operator's network, whereby flows are load-shared across parallel\
   paths (i.e., equal IGP cost).  Where the customer traffic may be\
   spread over multiple paths, the ability to detect failures on any of\
   the path permutations is required.  Where the spreading mechanism is\
   payload specific, payloads need to have forwarding that is common\
   with the traffic under test.  Satisfying these requirements\
   introduces complexity into ensuring that ECMP connectivity\
   permutations are exercised and that defect detection occurs in a\
   reasonable amount of time.\
\
4.2.  Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switched Path\
\
   The ability to diagnose a broken LSP and to isolate the failed\
   component (i.e., link or node) in the path is required.  For example,\
   note that specifying recovery actions for mis-branching defects in an\
   LDP network is a particularly difficult case.  Diagnosis of defects\
   and isolation of the failed component is best accomplished via a path\
   trace function that can return the entire list of LSRs and links used\
   by a certain LSP (or at least the set of LSRs/links up to the\
   location of the defect).  The tracing capability SHOULD include the\
   ability to trace recursive paths, such as when nested LSPs are used.\
   This path trace function MUST also be capable of diagnosing LSP mis-\
   merging by permitting comparison of expected vs. actual forwarding\
   behavior at any LSR in the path.  The path trace capability SHOULD be\
   capable of being executed from the head-end Label Switching Router\
   (LSR) and may permit downstream path components to be traced from an\
   intermediate mid-point LSR.  Additionally, the path trace function\
   MUST have the ability to support ECMP scenarios described in Section\
   4.1.\

\
\
4.3.  Path Characterization\
\
   The path characterization function is the ability to reveal details\
   of LSR forwarding operations.  These details can then be compared\
   during subsequent testing relevant to OAM functionality.  This\
   includes but is not limited to:\
\
      -  consistent use of pipe or uniform time to live (TTL) models by\
         an LSR [RFC3443].\
\
      -  sufficient details that allow the test origin to exercise all\
         path permutations related to load spreading (e.g., ECMP).\
\
      -  stack operations performed by the LSR, such as pushes, pops,\
         and TTL propagation at penultimate hop LSRs.\
\
4.4.  Service Level Agreement Measurement\
\
   Mechanisms are required to measure the diverse aspects of Service\
   Level Agreements, which include:\
\
      -  latency - amount of time required for traffic to transit the\
         network\
\
      -  packet loss\
\
      -  jitter - measurement of latency variation\
\
      -  defect free forwarding - the service is considered to be\
         available, or the service is unavailable and other aspects of\
         performance measurement do not have meaning.\
\
   Such measurements can be made independently of the user traffic or\
   via a hybrid of user traffic measurement and OAM probing.\
\
   At least one mechanism is required to measure the number of OAM\
   packets.  In addition, the ability to measure the quantitative\
   aspects of LSPs, such as jitter, delay, latency, and loss, MUST be\
   available in order to determine whether the traffic for a specific\
   LSP is traveling within the operator-specified tolerances.\
\
   Any method considered SHOULD be capable of measuring the latency of\
   an LSP with minimal impact on network resources.  See Section 2.1 for\
   definitions of the various quantitative aspects of LSPs.\

RFC 4377           OAM Requirements for MPLS Networks      February 2006\
\
\
4.5.  Frequency of OAM Execution\
\
   The operator MUST have the flexibility to configure OAM parameters to\
   meet their specific operational requirements.\
\
   This includes the frequency of the execution of any OAM functions.\
   The ability to synchronize OAM operations is required to permit a\
   consistent measurement of service level agreements.  To elaborate,\
   there are defect conditions, such as mis-branching or misdirection of\
   traffic, for which probe-based detection mechanisms that incur\
   significant mismatches in their detection frequency may result in\
   flapping.  This can be addressed either by synchronizing the rate or\
   having the probes self-identify their probe rate.  For example, when\
   the probing mechanisms are bootstrapping, they might negotiate and\
   ultimately agree on a probing rate, therefore providing a consistent\
   probing frequency and avoiding the aforementioned problems.\
\
   One observation would be that wide-spread deployment of MPLS, common\
   implementation of monitoring tools, and the need for inter-carrier\
   synchronization of defect and service level specification handling\
   will drive specification of OAM parameters to commonly agreed on\
   values.  Such values will have to be harmonized with the surrounding\
   technologies (e.g., SONET/SDH, ATM) to be useful.  This will become\
   particularly important as networks scale and mis-configuration can\
   result in churn, alarm flapping, etc.\
\
4.6.  Alarm Suppression, Aggregation, and Layer Coordination\
\
   Network elements MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that\
   prevents the generation of a superfluous generation of alarms by\
   simply discarding them (or not generating them in the first place),\
   or by aggregating them together, thereby greatly reducing the number\
   of notifications emitted.  When viewed in conjunction with the\
   requirement in Section 4.7 below, this typically requires fault\
   notification to the LSP egress that may have specific time\
   constraints if the application using the LSP independently implements\
   path continuity testing (for example, ATM I.610 Continuity check\
   (CC)[I610]).  These constraints apply to LSPs that are monitored.\
   The nature of MPLS applications allows for the possibility of having\
   multiple MPLS applications attempt to respond to defects\
   simultaneously, e.g., layer-3 MPLS VPNs that utilize Traffic\
   Engineered tunnels where a failure occurs on the LSP carrying the\
   Traffic Engineered tunnel.  This failure would affect the VPN traffic\
   that uses the tunnel's LSP.  Mechanisms are required to coordinate\
   network responses to defects.\

\
\
4.7.  Support for OAM Inter-working for Fault Notification\
\
   An LSR supporting the inter-working of one or more networking\
   technologies over MPLS MUST be able to translate an MPLS defect into\
   the native technology's error condition.  For example, errors\
   occurring over an MPLS transport LSP that supports an emulated ATM VC\
   MUST translate errors into native ATM OAM Alarm Indication Signal\
   (AIS) cells at the termination points of the LSP.  The mechanism\
   SHOULD consider possible bounded detection time parameters, e.g., a\
   "hold off" function before reacting to synchronize with the OAM\
   functions.\
\
   One goal would be alarm suppression by the upper layer using the LSP.\
   As observed in Section 4.5, this requires that MPLS perform detection\
   in a bounded timeframe in order to initiate alarm suppression prior\
   to the upper layer independently detecting the defect.\
\
4.8.  Error Detection and Recovery\
\
   Recovery from a fault by a network element can be facilitated by MPLS\
   OAM procedures.  These procedures will detect a broader range of\
   defects than that of simple link and node failures.  Since MPLS LSPs\
   may span multiple routing areas and service provider domains, fault\
   recovery and error detection should be possible in these\
   configurations as well as in the more simplified single-area/domain\
   configurations.\
\
   Recovery from faults SHOULD be automatic.  It is a requirement that\
   faults SHOULD be detected (and possibly corrected) by the network\
   operator prior to customers of the service in question detecting\
   them.\
\
4.9.  Standard Management Interfaces\
\
   The wide-spread deployment of MPLS requires common information\
   modeling of management and control of OAM functionality.  Evidence of\
   this is reflected in the standard IETF MPLS-related MIB modules\
   (e.g., [RFC3813][RFC3812][RFC3814]) for fault, statistics, and\
   configuration management.  These standard interfaces provide\
   operators with common programmatic interface access to Operations and\
   Management functions and their statuses.  However, gaps in coverage\
   of MIB modules to OAM and other features exist; therefore, MIB\
   modules corresponding to new protocol functions or network tools are\
   required.\

\
\
4.10.  Detection of Denial of Service Attacks\
\
   The ability to detect denial of service (DoS) attacks against the\
   data or control planes MUST be part of any security management\
   related to MPLS OAM tools or techniques.\
\
4.11.  Per-LSP Accounting Requirements\
\
   In an MPLS network, service providers can measure traffic from an LSR\
   to the egress of the network using some MPLS related MIBs, for\
   example.  This means that it is reasonable to know how much traffic\
   is traveling from location to location (i.e., a traffic matrix) by\
   analyzing the flow of traffic.  Therefore, traffic accounting in an\
   MPLS network can be summarized as the following three items:\
\
      (1) Collecting information to design network\
\
          For the purpose of optimized network design, a service\
          provider may offer the traffic information.  Optimizing\
          network design needs this information.\
\
      (2) Providing a Service Level Specification\
\
          Providers and their customers MAY need to verify high-level\
          service level specifications, either to continuously optimize\
          their networks, or to offer guaranteed bandwidth services.\
          Therefore, traffic accounting to monitor MPLS applications is\
          required.\
\
      (3) Inter-AS environment\
\
          Service providers that offer inter-AS services require\
          accounting of those services.\
\
      These three motivations need to satisfy the following:\
\
          -  In (1) and (2), collection of information on a per-LSP\
             basis is a minimum level of granularity for collecting\
             accounting information at both of ingress and egress of an\
             LSP.\
\
          -  In (3), SP's ASBR carry out interconnection functions as an\
             intermediate LSR.  Therefore, identifying a pair of ingress\
             and egress LSRs using each LSP is needed to determine the\
             cost of the service that a customer is using.\

RFC 4377           OAM Requirements for MPLS Networks      February 2006\
\
\
4.11.1.  Requirements\
\
   Accounting on a per-LSP basis encompasses the following set of\
   functions:\
\
      (1) At an ingress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs that\
          begin at each egress in question.\
\
      (2) At an intermediate LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for\
          each pair of ingress to egress.\
\
      (3) At egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs for each\
          ingress.\
\
      (4) All LSRs containing LSPs that are being measured need to have\
          a common identifier to distinguish each LSP.  The identifier\
          MUST be unique to each LSP, and its mapping to LSP SHOULD be\
          provided whether from manual or automatic configuration.\
\
      In the case of non-merged LSPs, this can be achieved by simply\
      reading traffic counters for the label stack associated with the\
      LSP at any LSR along its path.  However, in order to measure\
      merged LSPs, an LSR MUST have a means to distinguish the source of\
      each flow so as to disambiguate the statistics.\
\
4.11.2.  Location of Accounting\
\
   It is not realistic for LSRs to perform the described operations on\
   all LSPs that exist in a network.  At a minimum, per-LSP based\
   accounting SHOULD be performed on the edges of the network -- at the\
   edges of both LSPs and the MPLS domain.\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy the\
   requirements described herein are required to prevent their\
   unauthorized use.  Likewise, these network mechanisms MUST provide a\
   means by which an operator can prevent denial of service attacks if\
   those network mechanisms are used in such an attack.\
\
   LSP mis-merging has security implications beyond that of simply being\
   a network defect.  LSP mis-merging can happen due to a number of\
   potential sources of failure, some of which (due to MPLS label\
   stacking) are new to MPLS.\
\
   The performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization\
   involve extracting a significant amount of information about network\
   construction that the network operator MAY consider private.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The third-generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) for 3rd generation\
   cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain\
   audio/visual sequences that may be downloaded to cellular phones\
   [3gpp2].  At the time of writing, the 3GPP2 file format (3G2) can\
   contain H.263, H.264, or MPEG-4 video; and 13K Vocoder, EVRC or AMR\
   Narrow-band speech, or AAC audio; and 3GPP timed text.\

RFC 4393             3GPP2 Multimedia Registrations           March 2006\
\
\
   Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there is an\
   intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to\
   which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with\
   only one specification) are permitted by the content author to play\
   the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.\
   Files identified by the MIME [MIME1] type defined in this document\
   MUST contain, in their compatible brands list, a brand defined in a\
   standard (issued by 3GPP2) that can apply to 3GPP2 files.\
\
   The MIME types defined in this document are needed correctly to\
   identify such files when they are served over HTTP, included in\
   multi-part documents, or used in other places where MIME types are\
   used.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",\
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",\
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\
   [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Security Considerations\
\
   The 3GPP2 file format may contain audio, video, and displayable text\
   data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements (such as\
   scripts) of any kind.\
\
   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files that attempt to\
   call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio,\
   etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against\
   this kind of attack.\
\
   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may encompass\
   information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized\
   use or distribution.  In this case, the intention is that alteration\
   or removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense\
   under national agreement-based World Intellectual Property\
   Organization (WIPO) treaties.\
\
   3GPP2 files have an extensible structure, so it is theoretically\
   possible that metadata fields or media formats could be defined in\
   the future that could be used to induce particular actions on the\
   part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks; but\
   this type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced\
   specification.\

\
   Encryption, signing, or authentication of these file formats can be\
   done using any media-independent transformations of the file or media\
   data.\
\
3.  MIME Types\
\
   This registration applies to all files defined as using the '3G2'\
   file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP2\
   specification.  The usual file suffix for all these files is ".3g2".\
\
3.1.  Files with Audio but No Video\
\
   The type "audio/3gpp2" may be used for files containing audio but no\
   visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).\

RFC 4386                        PKIXREP                    February 2006\
\
\
1.  Overview\
\
   A number of RFCs (including [RFC2559], [RFC2560], and [RFC2585]) have\
   specified operational protocols for retrieval of PKI data, including\
   public-key certificates and revocation information, from PKI\
   repositories.  These RFCs assume that a certificate-using system has\
   the information necessary to identify, locate, and connect to the PKI\
   repository with a specific protocol.  Although some tools are\
   available in protocol-specific environments for this purpose, such as\
   knowledge references in directory systems, these are restricted for\
   use with a single protocol and do not share a common means of\
   publication.  This document provides a solution to this problem\
   through the use of Service Record (SRV) Resource Records (RRs) in\
   DNS.  This solution is expected to be particularly useful in\
   environments where only a domain name is available.  In other\
   situations (e.g., where a certificate is available that contains the\
   required information), such a DNS lookup is not needed.\
\
   [RFC2782] defines a DNS RR for specifying the location of services\
   (SRV).  This document defines SRV records for a PKI repository\
   locator service to enable PKI clients to obtain the necessary\
   information to connect to a domain's PKI repository, including\
   information about each protocol that is supported by that domain for\
   access to its repository.  This document includes the definition of\
   an SRV RR format for this service and an example of its potential use\
   in an email environment.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",\
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,\
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and\
   server, respectively.\
\
2.  SRV RR Definition\
\
   The format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33, is:\
\
    _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target\
\
   For the PKI repository locator service, this document uses the\
   symbolic name "PKIXREP".  Note that when used in an SRV RR, this name\
   MUST be prepended with an "_" character.\

RFC 4386                        PKIXREP                    February 2006\
\
\
   The protocols that can be included in PKIXREP SRV RRs are:\
\
      Protocol     SRV Prefix\
\
      LDAP         _LDAP\
      HTTP         _HTTP\
      OCSP         _OCSP\
\
2.1.  Assignment of New Protocol Prefixes\
\
   Protocol prefix assignments for new PKIX repository protocols SHOULD\
   be defined in the document that specifies the protocol.\
\
2.2.  Use of Multiple Repositories\
\
   The existence of multiple repositories MAY be determined by making\
   separate DNS queries for each of the protocols supported by the\
   client.\
\
   If this approach is found to be unacceptably inefficient due to a\
   proliferation of repository protocols at a future date, the service\
   discovery protocol could be extended to allow the repository to\
   advertise the protocols supported.\
\
2.3.  SRV RR Example\
\
   This example uses the fictional domain "example.com" as an aid in\
   understanding the use of SRV records by a certificate-using system.\
\
   Assume that Alice is an email client that needs a certificate for a\
   recipient.  Alice's client system supports LDAP for certificate\
   retrieval.  Assume the message recipient is Bob and that Bob's email\
   address is bob@example.com.  Assume that example.test maintains a\
   "border directory" PKI repository and that Bob's certificate is\
   available from that directory, "border.example.com", via LDAP.\
\
   Alice's client system retrieves, via DNS, the SRV record for\
   _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com.\
\
      -  The QNAME of the DNS query is _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com.\
\
      - The QCLASS of the DNS query is IN.\
\
      -  The QTYPE of the DNS query is SRV.\
\
   The result SHOULD include the host address for example.com's border\
   directory system.\

RFC 4386                        PKIXREP                    February 2006\
\
\
   Note that if example.com operated its service on a number of hosts,\
   more than one SRV RR would be returned.  In this case, RFC 2782\
   defines the procedure to be followed in determining which of these\
   should be accessed first.\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   Security issues regarding PKI repositories themselves are outside the\
   scope of this document.  For LDAP repositories, for example, specific\
   security considerations are addressed in RFC 2559.\
\
   Security issues with respect to the use of SRV records in general are\
   addressed in RFC 2782, and these issues apply to the use of SRV\
   records in the context of the PKIXREP service defined here.\
\
4.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document reserves the use of "_PKIXREP" service label.  Since\
   this relates to a service that may pass messages over a number of\
   different message transports, each message must be associated with a\
   specific transport.\
\
   In order to ensure that the association between "_PKIXREP" and their\
   respective underlying services is deterministic, the IANA has created\
   a new registry: PKIX SRV Protocol Labels.\
\
   For this registry, an entry shall consist of a label name and a\
   pointer to a specification describing how the protocol named in the\
   label uses SRV.  Specifications should conform to the requirements\
   listed in [RFC2434] for "specification required".\

Abstract\
\
   IP over Infiniband (IPoIB) link-layer address is 20 octets long.\
   This is larger than the 16 octets reserved for the hardware address\
   in a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol/Bootstrap Protocol\
   (DHCP/BOOTP) message.  The above inequality imposes restrictions on\
   the use of the DHCP message fields when used over an IPoIB network.\
   This document describes the use of DHCP message fields when\
   implementing DHCP over IPoIB.\

RFC 4390                  DHCP Over Infiniband                April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework\
   for passing configuration information to hosts on an IP network\
   [RFC2131].  DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC951]\
   adding the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network\
   addresses and additional configuration options [RFC2131,RFC2132].\
\
   The DHCP server receives a broadcast request from a client.  The DHCP\
   server uses the client interface's hardware address to unicast a\
   reply when the client does not yet have an IP address assigned to it.\
   The "chaddr" field in the DHCP message carries the client's hardware\
   address.\
\
   The "chaddr" field is 16 octets in length.  The IPoIB link-layer\
   address is 20 octets in length [RFC4391].  Therefore, the IPoIB\
   link-layer address will not fit in the "chaddr" field making it\
   impossible for the DHCP server to unicast a reply to the client.\
\
   To ensure interoperability, the usage of the fields and the method\
   for DHCP interaction must be clarified.  This document describes the\
   IPoIB-specific usage of some fields of DHCP.  See [RFC2131] for the\
   mechanism of DHCP and the explanations of each field.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  The DHCP over IPoIB Mechanism\
\
   As described above, the link-layer address is unavailable to the DHCP\
   server because the link-layer address is larger than the "chaddr"\
   field length.  As a result, the server cannot unicast its reply to\
   the client.  Therefore, a DHCP client MUST request that the server\
   send a broadcast reply by setting the BROADCAST flag when IPoIB\
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is not possible, i.e., in\
   situations where the client does not know its IP address.\
\
   [RFC1542] discourages the use of a broadcast reply.  But in the case\
   of IPoIB, this is a necessity because the server does not receive the\
   link-layer address.  To desynchronise broadcasts at subnet startup,\
   [RFC2131] suggests that a client wait a random time (1 to 10 seconds)\
   before initiating server discovery.  The same timeout will spread out\
   the DHCP server broadcast responses generated due to the use of the\
   BROADCAST bit.\
\
\

RFC 4390                  DHCP Over Infiniband                April 2006\
\
\
   The client hardware address, "chaddr", is unique in the subnet and\
   hence can be used to identify a client interface.  But in the absence\
   of a unique "chaddr", another unique client identifier must be used.\
\
   The DHCP protocol states that the "client identifier" option may be\
   used as the unique identifying value for the client [RFC2132].  This\
   value must be unique within the client's subnet.\
\
   The "client identifier" option includes a type and identifier pair.\
   The identifier included in the "client identifier" option may consist\
   of a hardware address or any other unique value such as the DNS name\
   of the client.  When a hardware address is used, the type field\
   should be one of the ARP hardware types listed in [ARPPARAM].\
\
2.1.  IPoIB-specific Usage of DHCP Message Fields\
\
   A DHCP client, when working over an IPoIB interface, MUST follow the\
   following rules:\
\
    "htype" (hardware address type) MUST be 32 [ARPPARAM].\
\
    "hlen" (hardware address length) MUST be 0.\
\
    "chaddr" (client hardware address) field MUST be zeroed.\
\
    "client-identifier" option MUST be used in DHCP messages.\
\
   The "client identifier" used in DHCP messages MUST conform to\
   [RFC4361].\
\
2.2.  Use of the BROADCAST flag\
\
   A DHCP client on IPoIB MUST set the BROADCAST flag in DHCPDISCOVER\
   and DHCPREQUEST messages (and set "ciaddr" to zero) to ensure that\
   the server (or the relay agent) broadcasts its reply to the client.\
\
   Note: As described in [RFC2131], "ciaddr" MUST be filled in with the\
         client's IP address during BOUND, RENEWING or REBINDING states;\
         therefore, the BROADCAST flag MUST NOT be set.  In these cases,\
         the DHCP server unicasts DHCPACK message to the address in\
         "ciaddr".  The link address will be resolved by ARP.\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   [RFC2131] describes the security considerations relevant to DHCP.\
   This document does not introduce any new issues.\

\
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current\
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of\
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\
\
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).\
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the\
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\
   [RFC2580].\

3.  Overview\
\
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\

RFC 4455                        SCSI MIB                      April 2006\
\
\
   SCSI is a client-server protocol in which application clients within\
   a SCSI initiator device (client) issue service requests to logical\
   units contained in a SCSI target device(server).\
\
   This MIB module is based on documents defined by the ANSI T10\
   Technical Committee, specifically the SCSI Architecture Model - 2\
   [SAM2] and SCSI Primary Commands - 2 [SPC2].\
\
   The [SAM2] standard is the primary source for the SCSI architecture\
   discussion in this document and the terminology used in this MIB\
   module.\
\
3.1.  Introduction\
\
   In the late 1970s, a firm called Shugart Associates started to have\
   some considerable success with a peripheral interface definition in\
   what became the PC marketplace, and this interface was adopted and\
   extended by an open standards committee to form the Small Computer\
   Systems Interface (SCSI).  SCSI defines an 8-bit-wide multi-drop\
   "bus" structure, which could interconnect a total of eight\
   peripherals and computer systems.\
\
   It is important to realize that initially SCSI standardized only the\
   "physical connection", i.e., the connectors, cables, and interface\
   signals.  Thus, even though a peripheral could be connected to\
   multiple systems, the information that flowed across the interface\
   was different in each case.  This was addressed some five years later\
   by the definition of a Common Command Set, and with this definition\
   in place it was possible for the first time to develop a peripheral\
   with both a common interface and common operating firmware for\
   connection to multiple systems.\
\
   The physical interface of SCSI continued to be developed throughout\
   the 1980s with the addition of fast (up to 10 megabytes/s) and wide\
   (16 bits) variants, but the distance supported remained a maximum of\
   25 meters (from one end of the bus to another), and indeed some of\
   the faster variants supported much less than that distance.  The\
   command set development continued, with special commands for tapes,\
   printers, and even processors being added to the original disk-\
   oriented set.  So successful was SCSI in the 1980s that the majority\
   of the available Operating Systems incorporated support for the SCSI\
   command set as standard.\
\
   However, at the end of the 1980s the distance, speed, and number of\
   devices supported by SCSI were starting to become significant\
   impediments to systems design, and although the "information\
   explosion" had not yet started in earnest, it was already being\
   anticipated.  At the same time, the serial interface technologies\

RFC 4455                        SCSI MIB                      April 2006\
\
\
   developed for Local Area Networks such as Ethernet, and the fibre\
   optics technologies that were first deployed in telecommunications\
   applications were starting to appear sufficiently rugged and low cost\
   for use in peripheral interface applications.  Thus, a standards\
   project was begun in 1988 to develop a new serial, fibre-optic\
   interface to carry the SCSI command sets and other peripheral\
   protocols.  This interface eventually became known as Fibre Channel\
   (FC), and it is based on an architecture centered around an\
   abstractly defined "fabric", which may be a switch or a loop\
   connection.  MIB modules for various FC equipments are already in\
   existence.\
\
   In order to support the new interfaces, it was necessary to\
   completely reorganize the SCSI standards and definitions.  The\
   command sets were separated from the physical interface definitions,\
   and a SCSI Architectural Model (SAM) was created to define the\
   interaction between the various standards.  It is a key to\
   understanding SAM to realize that it was first created approximately\
   10 years AFTER the first SCSI products were shipped!\
\
   The most recent development in this saga occurred in 2000 when an\
   IETF Working Group was formed to address, among other things, a\
   definition for transporting the SCSI command sets directly over a\
   TCP/IP infrastructure.  This effort is known as iSCSI [RFC3720], and\
   an iSCSI MIB module is already under development [ISCSI].\
\
   Most of the projects are in T10, except Fibre Channel, which is\
   defined by T11 and IEEE defines 1394.\
\
   The SCSI MIB module represents the SCSI protocol layer common to all\
   SCSI command sets and transports.  It does not represent the command\
   sets and transports themselves.  These should appear in other MIB\
   modules specific to the transport or command set.  The following\
   illustration shows the relationships between the various actual and\
   possible SCSI-related MIB modules.\

\
   An iSCSI MIB module [ISCSI] and a Fibre Channel interconnect MIB\
   module [RFC4044] are currently being developed.  No development is\
   currently planned for standard command-set-specific or device-\
   specific MIBs.\
\
   The TCP-MIB [RFC4022] is already a proposed standard RFC 4022.\
\
3.2.  SCSI Terminology\
\
   The following sections explain some of the SCSI terminology, which is\
   used later in defining the MIB module.  For the authoritative\
   definitions of these terms, see SAM-2 [SAM2].\
\
3.2.1.  SCSI Application Layer\
\
   The protocols and procedures that implement or invoke SCSI commands\
   and task management functions by using services provided by a SCSI\
   transport protocol layer.\
\
3.2.2.  SCSI Device\
\
   A SCSI device is an entity that contains one or more SCSI ports that\
   are connected to a service delivery subsystem and supports a SCSI\
   application protocol.\
\
3.2.3.  SCSI Port\
\
   A SCSI port is a device-resident entity that connects the application\
   client, device server, or task manager to the service delivery\
   subsystem through which requests and responses are routed.  A SCSI\
   port is synonymous with port and either a SCSI initiator port or a\
   SCSI target port.\

\
\
3.2.4.  SCSI Initiator Device\
\
   A SCSI initiator device contains application clients and SCSI\
   initiator ports that originate device service and task management\
   requests to be processed by a SCSI target device.  When used, this\
   term refers to SCSI initiator devices or SCSI target/initiator\
   devices that are using the SCSI target/initiator port as a SCSI\
   initiator port.\
\
3.2.5.  SCSI Initiator Port\
\
   A SCSI initiator port acts as the connection between application\
   clients and the service delivery subsystem through which requests and\
   responses are routed.  In all cases when this term is used, it refers\
   to an initiator port or a SCSI target/initiator port operating as a\
   SCSI initiator port.\
\
3.2.6.  SCSI Target Device\
\
   A SCSI target device contains logical units and SCSI target ports\
   that receive device service and task management requests for\
   processing.  When used, this term refers to SCSI target devices or\
   SCSI target/initiator devices that are using the SCSI\
   target/initiator port as a SCSI target port.\
\
3.2.7.  SCSI Target Port\
\
   A SCSI target port contains a task router and acts as the connection\
   between device servers and task managers and the service delivery\
   subsystem through which requests and responses are routed.  When this\
   term is used, it refers to a SCSI target port or a SCSI\
   target/initiator port operating as a SCSI target port.\
\
3.2.8.  Logical Units\
\
   A logical unit is an entity residing in the SCSI target device that\
   implements a device model and processes SCSI commands sent by an\
   application client.\
\
3.2.9.  Logical Unit Number\
\
   A Logical Unit Number or LUN is a 64-bit identifier for a logical\
   unit.\
\
3.2.10.  Interconnect Subsystem\
\
   An interconnect subsystem is one or more interconnects that appear as\
   a single path for the transfer of information between SCSI devices.\

\
\
3.2.11.  Device Server\
\
   A device server is an object within the logical unit that processes\
   SCSI tasks according to the rules for task management.\
\
3.2.12.  Task Manager\
\
   A task manager is a server within the SCSI target device that\
   processes task management functions.\
\
3.2.13.  SCSI Instance\
\
   A "SCSI instance" is a distinct SCSI entity within a managed system.\
   Whereas most implementations will have just one SCSI instance, the\
   MIB module allows for multiple (virtual) instances, such that a large\
   system can be "partitioned" into multiple, distinct virtual systems.\
\
   For example, in a host, it allows multiple vendors' implementations\
   of the MIB module to co-exist under a single SNMP agent through each\
   vendor's implementation being a different SCSI instance.  It also\
   allows a single SNMP agent to represent multiple subsystems each of\
   which has its own SCSI instance.\
\
3.3.  SCSI MIB Module Implementation\
\
   The SCSI MIB module is a basic building block to use in the various\
   SCSI management scenarios.  This module is intended to be implemented\
   in every SCSI entity in a managed system.  A SCSI entity can be a\
   SCSI initiator device, SCSI target device or SCSI initiator and\
   Target device.  Since SCSI (storage) networking devices may contain\
   more than one SCSI entity, it is possible that more than one SCSI\
   instance will reside in a single device.\
\
   In small-scale environments, a single network management station\
   (NMS) may have SNMP access to both SCSI initiator devices and SCSI\
   target devices.  However, if the SCSI target devices, or virtualized\
   target devices, are being provided as a service, it is more likely\
   that the provider of the service owns and manages the SCSI target\
   devices and that the consumer of the service owns and manages the\
   SCSI initiator devices.  In this case, the service provider NMS and\
   the consumer NMS may have only allowed SNMP access to the SCSI target\
   devices and the SCSI initiator devices, respectively.\
\
   The figures in this chapter describe the location of the SCSI MIB\
   module implementations in the various SCSI management scenarios.  The\
   locations of the SCSI SNMP agent implementing the SCSI MIB module are\
   denoted with '*'.\

     Figure 3.  Multiple Hosts, Virtualization Device and Multiple SCSI\
                Target Devices\
\
   Figure 3 adds an in-band virtualization device that encapsulates, and\
   possibly modifies, the SCSI target devices' representation to the\
   SCSI Initiator devices.  It is common practice for an in-band\
   virtualization device to include both SCSI target and initiator\
   device functionality.  Therefore, its SCSI MIB module implementation\
   includes both the SCSI Target device and Initiator device objects.\
   It should be noted that the Virtualization device might implement\
   additional proprietary MIB modules, as the SCSI MIB module does not\
   distinguish between physical and virtual SCSI entities.\
\
3.4.  Bridging and Virtualization\
\
   Storage virtualization is a concept that abstracts storage resources\
   in such a way that, storage entities are provided as pool of logical\
   entities.\
\
   Usually, the virtualization process is transparent to the storage\
   users (i.e., hosts).  Virtualization normally affects the SCSI\
   entities represented to SCSI initiator devices.  However, the SCSI\
   MIB module enables the representation of SCSI entities and their\
   respective status, including error and performance-monitoring\

\
\
   statistics.  It should be possible to perform a limited number of\
   configuration modification and diagnostic actions.\
\
   The SCSI entities embodied in the bridging and virtualization devices\
   can be represented by the SCSI MIB module.  However, the\
   configuration of bridging and virtualization devices is beyond the\
   above-described scope and therefore should be provided through other\
   MIB modules.\
\
3.5.  SCSI Command MIB Module\
\
   The management of SCSI commands is beyond the scope of this MIB\
   module.  Future SCSI Command MIB module can link to this MIB module,\
   through the use of Object Identifiers (OIDs) or INDEX values of\
   appropriate tables.\
\
4.  Structure of the MIB\
\
   This MIB module contains fourteen conformance groups:\
\
4.1.  The SCSI Device Group\
\
   The scsiDeviceGroup group contains the objects general to each SCSI\
   instance: instance, device, and port objects.  It contains also the\
   objects referring to the transport(s) used by those SCSI instances.\
   This group is mandatory for all SCSI managed system.\
\
   Alias objects are provided for SCSI instances and SCSI devices to\
   enable administrators to identify them.  These objects contain\
   human-readable administrative text strings, and hence use the\
   SnmpAdminString textual convention from [RFC3411].\
\
4.2.  The Initiator Group\
\
   The scsiInitiatorDeviceGroup contains all the managed information\
   related to a local SCSI initiator device and port.  In addition, it\
   contains the managed objects referring to the monitored attached SCSI\
   target devices.  Any managed system acting as a SCSI initiator or\
   target/initiator device and port MUST support this group.\
\
4.3.  The Target Group\
\
   The scsiTargetDeviceGroup contains all the managed objects related to\
   a local SCSI target device, a local SCSI target port, monitored\
   attached initiator ports, logical units, and logical unit\
   identifiers.\

\
   Managed systems acting as a SCSI target or target/initiator device\
   and port must support this group.\
\
4.4.  The Discovery Group\
\
   The scsiDiscoveryGroup group is a collection of managed objects\
   referring to remote SCSI target devices, remote SCSI target ports,\
   remote logical units, and remote logical unit identifiers discovered\
   by or configured to a managed system acting as a SCSI initiator\
   device.\
\
   Managed systems acting as a SCSI initiator device and port and\
   supporting remote SCSI target devices or ports configuration or\
   discovery should implement this group.\
\
4.5.  The LUN Map Group\
\
   The scsiLunMapGroup group is a collection of managed objects allowing\
   mapping between SCSI target devices, logical units, and logical unit\
   numbers in one side to remote authorized SCSI initiator devices or\
   ports in another side.\
\
   Managed systems supporting this mapping should implement the\
   scsiLunMapGroup.\
\
4.6.  The Target Statistic Group\
\
   The scsiTargetDevStatsGroup group is a collection of managed objects\
   representing various statistics referring to a SCSI target device or\
   port.  Managed systems acting as a SCSI target device and port\
   supporting statistics should implement this group.\
\
4.7.  The Target High Speed Statistic Group\
\
   The scsiTargetDevHSStatsGroup group is a collection of managed\
   objects representing various statistics referring to a SCSI target\
   device or port.  It provides support for systems that can quickly\
   generate countable information because they run at high speed.\
\
   Managed systems acting as a SCSI target device and port and running\
   at high speed supporting should implement this group.\
\
4.8.  The LUN Map Statistics Group\

   The scsiLunMapStatsGroup group is a collection of managed objects\
   representing various statistics referring to remote authorized SCSI\
   initiator devices or ports.\

\
5.  Relationships in This MIB\
\
   This section outlines the functionality and the dependency between\
   the MIB tables providing the required management functionality for\
   SCSI initiator and target devices.  For specific usage of these\
   tables, the reader should refer to the description of the tables and\
   their respective table entries and attributes.\
\
   Following is a list of required SCSI initiator-related features, and\
   the respective tables facilitating this functionality:\
\
   o  List all the SCSI initiator ports that should be managed through\
      this MIB module.  The table scsiIntrPortTable maintains all the\
      SCSI initiator ports for the SCSI initiator devices in the MIB\
      module.\
\
   o  Provide a list of all SCSI target ports or SCSI target devices to\
      which a SCSI initiator port can attach.  This should prevent a\
      SCSI initiator device or port from attaching to SCSI target\
      devices that should be either invisible or inaccessible to it.\
      The entries in this list can be created either manually or by\
      automatic discovery mechanisms (e.g., SLP, iSNS).  The\
      ScsiDscTgtTable provides this information.  The entries in this\
      table point to the SCSI initiator port, and indicate that the SCSI\
      initiator port can only attach to SCSI target ports or SCSI target\
      devices provided in the respective entries of the ScsiDscTgtTable.\

\
\
      This MIB module permits, but does not require, this table to be\
      written via SNMP.  There are significant security considerations\
      in allowing writes to this table; see Section 11.\
\
   o  The information, for the aforementioned SCSI target ports or SCSI\
      target devices, about the LUs and their respective LUN Ids should\
      be provided.  The scsiDscLunTable and scsiDscLunIdTable maintain\
      this information.\
\
   o  The scsiAttTgtPortTable provides the information about the SCSI\
      target ports each SCSI initiator port is currently communicating\
      with.  This table should be dynamically updated to reflect those\
      connections.\
\
   Following is a list of required SCSI target device-related features,\
   and the respective tables facilitating this functionality:\
\
   o  List all the SCSI target ports that should be managed through this\
      MIB module.  The table scsiTgtPortTable maintains all the SCSI\
      target ports for the SCSI target devices in the MIB module.\
\
   o  Provide a list of valid SCSI initiator ports or SCSI initiator\
      devices authorized to attach to a SCSI target port.  This list\
      should feature the concept of "access lists", which are common in\
      IP routers and switches.  The ScsiAuthorizedIntr table provides\
      this information.  This MIB module permits, but does not require\
      this table to be written via SNMP.  There are significant security\
      considerations in allowing writes to this table; see Section 11.\
\
   o  It should be possible to specify the list of LUNs exposed to each\
      SCSI initiator port or device, when it is attached to the SCSI\
      target device.  SCSI target devices must provide a default list of\
      LUNs.  This list of LUNs can either be a unique list for each SCSI\
      initiator device or be the default list.  For each entry in the\
      ScsiAuthorizedIntr table, a pointer, named\
      scsiAuthIntrLunMapIndex, indexing the ScsiLunMapTable facilitates\
      this feature.\

RFC 4455                        SCSI MIB                      April 2006\
\
\
6.  Relationship to Other MIBs\
\
6.1.  Host Resource MIB\
\
   The SCSI MIB module extends objects defined in the host resource MIB\
   module to SCSI-specific entities but does not contain information on\
   software modules such as device drivers.  If MIB objects are required\
   for installed packages of SCSI software, then the hrSWInstalledGroup\
   of the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] are the standard MIB objects to\
   use.\
\
6.2.  iSCSI MIB Module\
\
   The SCSI MIB module defines managed objects for the SCSI protocol\
   layer.  The SCSI layer can run on top of several transport layers;\
   iSCSI is one of them.  The ISCSI-MIB [ISCSI] is the MIB portion\
   defining the managed objects for the transport called iSCSI.  In the\
   same way, a fibre channel or parallel SCSI MIB module would define\
   managed objects for a transport called, respectively, fibre channel\
   or parallel SCSI.\
\
   The relationship between the SCSI MIB module and any valid transport\
   MIB module is determined via the SCSI port managed table that has an\
   object pointing to the corresponding row, if any, of the relevant\
   table in a transport MIB module.\
\
7.  Miscellaneous Details\
\
7.1.  Names and Identifiers\
\
   The names and the identifiers of the SCSI devices, ports, and logical\
   units depend on the underlying transport protocols; their format and\
   length vary accordingly.  Please refer to SAM-2 [SAM2] for more\
   details.\
\
7.2.  Logical Unit Number\
\
   The Logical Unit Number is a 64-bit integer.  This type does not\
   exist in SMI and therefore, this MIB contains a textual convention\
   defining LUN as an OCTET STRING.\
\
7.3.  Notifications\
\
   Separate SNMP notifications may be enabled/disabled to notify of a\
   change in any of the SCSI device status variables.  A notification\
   will be generated theoretically for each occurrence (see restriction\
\

\
\
   below) of the abnormal status (e.g., if the SCSI device's current\
   status is abnormal and another logical unit changes its status from\
   available to abnormal another notification will occur).\
\
   To avoid sending an excessive number of notifications due to multiple\
   errors counted, an SNMP agent implementing the SCSI MIB module should\
   not send more than three SCSI notifications in any 10-second period.\
\
   The 3-in-10 rule was chosen because one notification every three\
   seconds was deemed often enough, but if and when two or three\
   different notifications happen at the same time, it would not be\
   desirable to suppress them.  Three notifications in 10 seconds is a\
   happy medium, where a short burst of notifications is allowed,\
   without inundating the network and/or destination host with a large\
   number of notifications.\
\
   The ultimate control on sending of notifications is in command of the\
   notification generator module specified in [RFC3413].\
\
7.4.  SCSI Domains\
\
   SAM-2 [SAM2] specifies that devices belong to a domain.  However, it\
   is not usually possible to determine this from within a system, so\
   domains are not represented within this MIB module.\
\
7.5.  Counters: 32 Bits and 64 Bits\
\
   Some counters, in (newer) high-performance systems, can increase at a\
   fast enough rate such that their representation as Counter32s can\
   cause them to "wrap" in less than an hour.  The SMIv2 provides\
   Counter64 as the syntax for such counters.  However, (older) SNMPv1\
   implementations cannot support Counter64s.  Thus, this MIB module\
   defines such counters as both Counter32s and Counter64's.\
\
   The counters in this MIB module that count data are defined in terms\
   of megabytes (i.e., as the number of megabytes of data), such that\
   Counter64s are not required.\
\
   However, the counters in this MIB module that count commands, when in\
   use at 5 GBit/second with 512-byte read/write operations, could wrap\
   within an hour.  Therefore, each of these counters will be defined as\
   both a Counter32 and a Counter64, with the latter being mandatory,\
   for system speeds of 4 Gbit/second or higher.\
\
   A possible (but not required) implementation strategy is to have the\
   value of each Counter32 be the same value as the low-order 32 bits of\
   the corresponding Counter64.\

\
\
7.6.  Local versus Remote Entities\
\
   This MIB module qualifies often SCSI entities as local or remote.\
   The local entities are the ones for which the agent is reporting.\
   The remote entities are the ones that the local entities are in\
   communication with via the SCSI protocol.\
\
8.  Abbreviations\
\
   This MIB module will use the following abbreviations:\
\
      Inst = Instance\
\
      Dev = SCSI Device\
\
      Tgt = SCSI Target Device\
\
      Intr = SCSI Initiator Device\

10.  Object Population Example: SCSI Target and Initiator Devices on a\
     pSCSI Bus\
\
   This section provides a sample set of values for a parallel SCSI\
   scenario in which a SCSI MIB module can be implemented.  The example\
   shown below is not a normative part of this document and makes some\
   assumptions about the underlying implementation, which are not based\
   on actual implementations.\
\
   The respective sections describe the sequence of object\
   instantiations and attempts to explain non-typical values for\
   attributes that are unique to the scenario.\
\
   Note: While populating the objects, the population of statistics is\
   not considered.\
\
   This scenario deals with a SCSI target and initiator devices attached\
   to a parallel SCSI bus, defined by one of the SCSI-3 Parallel\
   Interface standards (the version referenced in the MIB module is the\
   4th generation, called SPI-4).  We assume that the SCSI initiator\
   device is a Host Bus Adaptor (HBA), and the SCSI target device is a\
   physical disk.  We assume that the SCSI target device has one\
   integrated logical unit, identified by a Logical Unit Number (LUN) of\
   0, which is the default LUN.  The parallel SCSI transport only\
   supports port identifiers, and not port names.  The transport pointer\
   is set to 0 since there is no MIB module defined for SPI-4.\
\
   We assume an HBA as the SCSI initiator device and a disk as the SCSI\
   target device.  We assume that the SCSI target device has one logical\
   unit, addressed by Logical Unit Number set to 0 (LUN0), which is the\
   default LUN.  Parallel SCSI has only port identifiers, no port names.\
   The transport pointer for parallel SCSI is set to 0 since there is no\
   reference transport (SPI) MIB module.\
\
   Once the SCSI system is initialized, an SNMP agent should be able to\
   view the values of variables populated in the ScsiDevice,\
   ScsiInitiatorDevice, ScsiTargetDevice, ScsiPort, ScsiTargetPort,\
   ScsiInitiatorPort, ScsiLogicalUnit, ScsiLUIdentifier objects.\
\
   The ScsiAuthorizedIntr population depends on the transport and the\
   implementation.  As this example scenario is parallel SCSI, we deal\
   with the ports.  Hence the ScsiPortIndexOrZero is the index of the\
   SCSI target port and ScsiAuthIntrDevOrPort is "port".  Same is the\
   case with the variables in scsiDscTgtDevOrPort.\
\
   Note that "" means zero-length string.\

11.  Security Considerations\
\
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on\
   network operations.  These are the following:\
\
   o  scsiInstAlias, scsiInstScsiNotificationsEnable,\
      scsiInstStorageType and scsiDeviceAlias: these objects can be\
      manipulated to affect the management of a SCSI instance and its\

\
\
      devices; specifically, the SCSI instance's administrative alias,\
      whether it generates notifications, whether its non-default\
      parameter settings are retained over restarts, and the\
      administrative alias for each of its devices.\
\
   o  scsiIntrDevTgtAccessMode: this object can be manipulated to allow\
      immediate access by local SCSI initiator devices to discovered\
      SCSI target devices without waiting for administrator approval,\
      where such approval might not be forthcoming.\
\
   o  scsiDscTgtTable: the objects in this table can be manipulated to\
      remove administrator-specified controls on access by local SCSI\
      initiator devices to discovered SCSI target devices.\
\
   o  scsiAuthorizedIntrTable: the objects in this table can be\
      manipulated to remove administrator-specified controls on access\
      by remote SCSI initiator devices to local SCSI target devices.\
\
   o  scsiLunMapTable: the objects in this table can be manipulated to\
      provide access by a remote SCSI initiator device to logical units\
      that an administrator has configured as not accessible to said\
      initiator.\
\
   In each of the last four cases, the objects in the tables can also be\
   manipulated to cause a denial of service attack, by preventing\
   administrator-authorized access.\
\
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\
   the network via SNMP.  All seventeen of the tables in this MIB module\
   contain information which might be considered sensitive to read\
   access in some environments, e.g.,\
\
   o  the settings of all read-write/read-create parameter objects\
      mentioned above,\
\
   o  scsiInstSoftwareIndex, scsiInstVendorVersion\
      --which version of which software is running;\
\
   o  scsiDeviceRole, scsiPortRole, scsiTransportType,\
      scsiTransportPointer, scsiTransportDevName, scsiDscLunIdCodeSet,\
      scsiDscLunIdAssociation, scsiDscLunIdType, scsiDscLunIdValue plus\
      information in several tables: scsiTgtDevTable, scsiLuTable,\
      scsiLuIdTable, scsiLunMapTable\

      information about such targets, including detailed information\

      units;\

      -- information about which initiators are authorized to connect to\
      that targets.\
\
   These information may need to be kept private in sensitive\
   environments.\
\
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec),\
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\
   in this MIB module.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\
   authentication and privacy).\
\
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document describes the specifics of how to use the Layer 2\
   Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\
   Pseudowires, including encapsulation, carrying various ATM services,\
   such as AAL5 SDU, ATM VCC/VPC/Port cell relay over L2TP, and mapping\
   ATM defects to L2TP Set-Link-Info (SLI) messages to notify the peer\
   L2TP Control Connection Endpoint (LCCE).\
\
   Any ATM-specific AVPs or other L2TP constructs for ATM Pseudowire\
   (ATMPW) support are defined here as well.  Support for ATM Switched\
   Virtual Path/Connection (SVP/SVC) and Soft Permanent Virtual\
   Path/Connection (SPVP/SPVC) are outside the scope of this document.\
\
   The reader is expected to be very familiar with the terminology and\
   protocol constructs defined in [RFC3931].\

1.2.  Specification of Requirements\
\
   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements\
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key\
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",\
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document\
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Control Connection Establishment\
\
   To emulate ATM Pseudowires using L2TP, an L2TP Control Connection as\
   described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3931] MUST be established.\
\
   The Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) and corresponding\
   Start-Control-Connection-Reply (SCCRP) MUST include the supported ATM\
   Pseudowire types (see Section 3.1), in the Pseudowire Capabilities\
   List as defined in Section 5.4.3 of [RFC3931].  This identifies the\
   Control Connection as able to establish L2TP sessions in support of\
   the ATM Pseudowires.\

RFC 4454                    ATM over L2TPv3                     May 2006\
\
\
   An LCCE MUST be able to uniquely identify itself in the SCCRQ and\
   SCCRP messages via a globally unique value.  By default, this is\
   advertised via the structured Router ID AVP [RFC3931], though the\
   unstructured Hostname AVP [RFC3931] MAY be used to identify LCCEs as\
   well.\
\
3.  Session Establishment and ATM Circuit Status Notification\
\
   This section describes how L2TP ATMPWs or sessions are established\
   between two LCCEs.  This includes what will happen when an ATM\
   circuit (e.g., AAL5 PVC) is created, deleted, or changes state when\
   circuit state is in alarm.\
\
3.1.  L2TPv3 Session Establishment\
\
   ATM circuit (e.g., an AAL5 PVC) creation triggers establishment of an\
   L2TP session using three-way handshake described in Section 3.4.1 of\
   [RFC3931].  An LCCE MAY initiate the session immediately upon ATM\
   circuit creation, or wait until the circuit state transitions to\
   ACTIVE before attempting to establish a session for the ATM circuit.\
   It MAY be preferred to wait until circuit status transitions to\
   ACTIVE in order to delay the allocation of resources until absolutely\
   necessary.\
\
   The Circuit Status AVP (see Section 8) MUST be present in the\
   Incoming-Call-Request (ICRQ) and Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP) messages,\
   and MAY be present in the SLI message for ATMPWs.\
\
   The following figure shows how L2TP messages are exchanged to set up\
   an ATMPW after the ATM circuit (e.g., an AAL5 PVC) becomes ACTIVE.\

RFC 4454                    ATM over L2TPv3                     May 2006\
\
\
   The following signaling elements are required for the ATMPW\
   establishment.\
\
   a. Pseudowire Type: One of the supported ATM-related PW types should\
      be present in the Pseudowire Type AVP of [RFC3931].\
\
      0x0002  ATM AAL5 SDU VCC transport\
      0x0003  ATM Cell transport Port Mode\
      0x0009  ATM Cell transport VCC Mode\
      0x000A  ATM Cell transport VPC Mode\
\
   The above cell relay modes can also signal the ATM Maximum\
   Concatenated Cells AVP as described in Section 6.\
\
   b. Remote End ID: Each PW is associated with a Remote End ID akin to\
      the VC-ID in [PWE3ATM].  Two LCCEs of a PW would have the same\
      Remote End ID, and its format is described in Section 5.4.4 of\
      [RFC3931].\
\
      This Remote End ID AVP MUST be present in the ICRQ in order for\
      the remote LCCE to associate the session to the ATM circuit.  The\
      Remote End Identifier AVP defined in [RFC3931] is of opaque form,\
      though ATMPW implementations MAY simply use a 4-octet value\
      that is known to both LCCEs (either by direct configuration or\
      some other means).  The exact method of how this value is\
      configured, retrieved, discovered, or otherwise determined at\
      each LCCE is outside the scope of this document.\
\
   As with the ICRQ, the ICRP is sent only after the ATM circuit\
   transitions to ACTIVE.  If LCCE B had not been provisioned yet for\
   the ATM circuit identified in the ICRQ, a Call-Disconnect-Notify\
   (CDN) would have been immediately returned indicating that the\
   circuit either was not provisioned or was not available at this LCCE.\
   LCCE A SHOULD then exhibit a periodic retry mechanism.  If so, the\
   period and maximum number of retries MUST be configurable.\
\
   An implementation MAY send an ICRQ or ICRP before a PVC is ACTIVE, as\
   long as the Circuit Status AVP reflects that the ATM circuit is\
   INACTIVE and an SLI is sent when the ATM circuit becomes ACTIVE (see\
   Section 8).\
\
   The ICCN is the final stage in the session establishment.  It\
   confirms the receipt of the ICRP with acceptable parameters to allow\
   bidirectional traffic.\

RFC 4454                    ATM over L2TPv3                     May 2006\
\
\
3.2.  L2TPv3 Session Teardown\
\
   When an ATM circuit is unprovisioned (deleted) at either LCCE, the\
   associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via the CDN message defined\
   in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC3931].\
\
3.3.  L2TPv3 Session Maintenance\
\
   All sessions established by a given Control Connection utilize the\
   L2TP Hello facility defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC3931] for session\
   keepalive.  This gives all sessions basic dead peer and path\
   detection between LCCEs.\
\
   If the control channel utilizing the Hello message is not in-band\
   with data traffic over the PSN, then other method MAY be used to\
   detect the session failure, and it is left for further study.\
\
   ATMPWs over L2TP use the Set-Link-Info (SLI) control message as\
   defined in [RFC3931] to signal ATM circuit status between LCCEs after\
   initial session establishment.  This includes ACTIVE or INACTIVE\
   notifications of the ATM circuit, or any other parameters that may\
   need to be shared between the LCCEs in order to provide proper PW\
   emulation.\
\
   The SLI message MUST be sent whenever there is a status change that\
   may be reported by any values identified in the Circuit Status AVP.\
   The only exceptions to this are the initial ICRQ, ICRP, and CDN\
   messages, which establish and tear down the L2TP session itself when\
   the ATM circuit is created or deleted.  The SLI message may be sent\
   from either LCCE at any time after the first ICRQ is sent (and\
   perhaps before an ICRP is received, requiring the peer to perform a\
   reverse Session ID lookup).\
\
   The other application of the SLI message is to map the ATM OAM or\
   physical layer alarms into Circuit Status AVP as described in Section\
   8.\
\
4.  Encapsulation\
\
   This section describes the general encapsulation format for ATM\
   services over L2TP.\

   The PSN Transport header is specific to IP and its underlying\
   transport header.  This header is used to transport the encapsulated\
   ATM payload through the IP network.\
\
   The Session Header is a non-zero 32-bit Session ID with an optional\
   Cookie up to 64-bits.  This Session ID is exchanged during session\
   setup.\

\
\
      * B and E bits\
\
      Definitions of these bits are as per Section 5.5 of [L2TPFRAG].\
\
      If these bits are not used as per [L2TPFRAG], they MUST be set to\
      0 upon transmission and ignored upon reception.\
\
      * T (Transport type) bit\
\
      Bit (T) of the ATM-Specific Sublayer indicates whether the packet\
      contains an ATM admin cell or an AAL5 payload.  If T = 1, the\
      packet contains an ATM admin cell, encapsulated according to the\
      VCC cell relay encapsulation of Section 5.2.\
\
      If not set, the PDU contains an AAL5 payload.  The ability to\
      transport an ATM cell in the AAL5 SDU Mode is intended to provide\
      a means of enabling administrative functionality over the AAL5 VCC\
      (though it does not endeavor to preserve user-cell and admin-cell\
      arrival/transport ordering, as described in Section 9.1).\
\
      * G (EFCI) Bit\
\
      The ingress LCCE device SHOULD set this bit to 1 if the Explicit\
      Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) bit of the final cell of the\
      incoming AAL5 payload is set to 1, or if the EFCI bit of the\
      single ATM cell to be transported in the packet is set to 1.\
      Otherwise, this bit SHOULD be set to 0.  The egress LCCE device\
      SHOULD set the EFCI bit of all the outgoing cells that transport\
      the AAL5 payload to the value contained in this field.\
\
      * C (CLP) Bit\
\
      The ingress LCCE device SHOULD set this bit to 1 if the Cell Loss\
      Priority (CLP) bit of any of the incoming ATM cells of the AAL5\
      payload is set to 1, or if the CLP bit of the single ATM cell that\
      is to be transported in the packet is set to 1.  Otherwise this\
      bit SHOULD be set to 0.  The egress LCCE device SHOULD set the CLP\
      bit of all outgoing cells that transport the AAL5 CPCS-PDU to the\
      value contained in this field.\

\
\
      * U (Command/Response) Bit\
\
      When FRF.8.1 Frame Relay / ATM PVC Service Interworking (see\
      [FRF8.1]) traffic is being transported, the CPCS-UU Least\
      Significant Bit (LSB) of the AAL5 CPCS-PDU may contain the Frame\
      Relay C/R bit.  The ingress LCCE device SHOULD copy this bit to\
      the U bit of the ATM-Specific Sublayer.  The egress LCCE device\
      SHOULD copy the U bit to the CPCS-UU Least Significant Bit (LSB)\
      of the AAL5 payload.\
\
      The Sequence Number field is used in sequencing, as described in\
      Section 4.2.\
\
   In case of a reassembly timeout, the encapsulating LCCE should\
   discard all component cells of the AAL5 frame.\
\
   An additional enumeration is added to the L2-Specific Sublayer AVP to\
   identify the ATM-Specific Sublayer:\
\
         0 - There is no L2-Specific Sublayer present.\
         1 - The Default L2-Specific Sublayer (defined in Section 4.6\
             of [RFC3931]) is used.\
         2 - The ATM-Specific Sublayer is used.\
\
   The first two values are already defined in the L2TPv3 base\
   specification [RFC3931].\
\
4.2.  Sequencing\
\
   Data Packet Sequencing MAY be enabled for ATMPWs.  The sequencing\
   mechanisms described in [RFC3931] MUST be used to signal sequencing\
   support.  ATMPWs over L2TPv3 MUST request the presence of the ATM-\
   Specific Sublayer when sequencing is enabled, and MAY request its\
   presence at all times.\
\
5.  ATM Transport\
\
   There are two encapsulations supported for ATM transport as described\
   below.\
\
   The ATM-Specific Sublayer is prepended to the AAL5-SDU.  The other\
   cell mode encapsulation consists of the OPTIONAL ATM-Specific\
   Sublayer, followed by a 4-byte ATM cell header and a 48-byte ATM\
   cell-payload.\

\
5.1.  ATM AAL5-SDU Mode\
\
   In this mode, each AAL5 VC is mapped to an L2TP session.  The Ingress\
   LCCE reassembles the AAL5 CPCS-SDU without the AAL5 trailer and any\
   padding bytes.  Incoming EFCI, CLP, and C/R (if present) are carried\
   in an ATM-Specific Sublayer across ATMPWs to the egress LCCE.  The\
   processing of these bits on ingress and egress LCCEs is defined in\
   Section 4.1.\

                 Figure 3: ATM AAL5-SDU Mode Encapsulation\
\
   If the ingress LCCE determines that an encapsulated AAL5 SDU exceeds\
   the MTU size of the L2TPv3 session, then AAL5 SDU may be fragmented\
   as per [L2TPFRAG] or underneath the transport layer (IP, etc.).  F5\
   OAM cells that arrive during the reassembly of an AAL5 SDU are sent\
   immediately on the PW followed by the AAL5 SDU payload.  In this\
   case, OAM cells' relative order with respect to user data cells is\
   not maintained.\
\
   Performance Monitoring OAM, as specified in ITU-T 610 [I610-1],\
   [I610-2], [I610-3] and security OAM cells as specified in [ATMSEC],\
   should not be used in combination with AAL5 SDU Mode.  These cells\
   MAY be dropped at the ingress LCCE because cell sequence integrity is\
   not maintained.\
\
   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\
   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the ICRQ messages and MUST\
   include the ATM AAL5 SDU VCC transport PW Type of 0x0002.\
\
5.2.  ATM Cell Mode\
\
   In this mode, ATM cells skip the reassembly process at the ingress\
   LCCE.  These cells are transported over an L2TP session, either as a\
   single cell or as concatenated cells, into a single packet.  Each ATM\
   cell consists of a 4-byte ATM cell header and a 48-byte ATM cell-\
   payload; the HEC is not included.\

                   Figure 4: ATM Cell Mode Encapsulation\
\
   In the simplest case, this encapsulation can be used to transmit a\
   single ATM cell per Pseudowire PDU.  However, in order to provide\
   better Pseudowire bandwidth efficiency, several ATM cells may be\
   optionally encapsulated into a single Pseudowire PDU.\
\
   The maximum number of concatenated cells in a packet is limited by\
   the MTU size of the session and also by the ability of the egress\
   LCCE to process them.  For more details about ATM Maximum\
   Concatenated Cells, please refer to Section 6.\
\
5.2.1.  ATM VCC Cell Relay Service\
\
   A VCC cell relay service may be provided by mapping an ATM Virtual\
   Channel Connection to a single Pseudowire using cell mode\
   encapsulation as defined in Section 5.2.\
\
   An LCCE may map one or more VCCs to a single PW.  However, a service\
   provider may wish to provision a single VCC to a PW in order to\
   satisfy QOS or restoration requirements.\

\
   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\
   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the ICRQ messages and MUST\
   include the ATM cell transport VCC Mode PW Type of 0x0009.\
\
5.2.2.  ATM VPC Cell Relay Service\
\
   A Virtual Path Connection cell relay service may be provided by\
   mapping an ATM Virtual Path Connection to a single Pseudowire using\
   cell mode encapsulation as defined in Section 5.2.\
\
   An LCCE may map one or more VPCs to a single Pseudowire.\
\
   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\
   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the ICRQ messages and MUST\
   include the ATM cell transport VPC Mode PW Type of 0x000A.\
\
5.2.3.  ATM Port Cell Relay Service\
\
   ATM port cell relay service allows an ATM port to be connected to\
   another ATM port.  All ATM cells that are received at the ingress ATM\
   port on the LCCE are encapsulated as per Section 5.2, into Pseudowire\
   PDU and sent to peer LCCE.\
\
   Each LCCE MUST discard any idle/unassigned cells received on an ATM\
   port associated with ATMPWs.\
\
   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\
   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the ICRQ messages and MUST\
   include the ATM Cell transport Port Mode PW Type of 0x0003.\
\
5.3.  OAM Cell Support\
\
   The OAM cells are defined in [I610-1], [I610-2], [I610-3] and\
   [ATMSEC] can be categorized as follows:\
\
      a.  Fault Management\
      b.  Performance monitoring and reporting\
      c.  Activation/deactivation\
      d.  System Management (e.g., security OAM cells)\
\
   OAM Cells are always encapsulated using cell mode encapsulation,\
   regardless of the encapsulation format used for user data.\
\
5.3.1.  VCC Switching\
\
   The LCCEs SHOULD be able to pass the F5 segment and end-to-end Fault\
   Management, Resource Management (RM cells), Performance Management,\
   Activation/deactivation, and System Management OAM cells.\

\
\
   F4 OAM cells are inserted or extracted at the VP link termination.\
   These OAM cells are not seen at the VC link termination and are\
   therefore not sent across the PW.\
\
5.3.2.  VPC Switching\
\
   The LCCEs MUST be able to pass the F4 segment and end-to-end Fault\
   Management, Resource Management (RM cells), Performance Management,\
   Activation/deactivation, and System Management OAM cells\
   transparently according to [I610-1].\
\
   F5 OAM cells are not inserted or extracted at the VP cross-connect.\
   The LCCEs MUST be able to pass the F5 OAM cells transparently across\
   the PW.\
\
6.  ATM Maximum Concatenated Cells AVP\
\
   The "ATM Maximum Concatenated Cells AVP", Attribute Type 86,\
   indicates that the egress LCCE node can process a single PDU with\
   concatenated cells up to a specified number of cells.  An LCCE node\
   transmitting concatenated cells on this PW MUST NOT exceed the\
   maximum number of cells as specified in this AVP.  This AVP is\
   applicable only to ATM Cell Relay PW Types (VCC, VPC, Port Cell\
   Relay).  This Attribute value may not be same in both directions of\
   the specific PW.\
\
   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:\
\
    0                   1\
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5\

   | ATM Maximum Concatenated Cells|\
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\
\
   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this\
   AVP MAY be set to 0, but MAY vary (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3931]).\
   The length (before hiding) of this AVP is 8.\
\
   This AVP is sent in an ICRQ, ICRP during session negotiation or via\
   SLI control messages when LCCE changes the maximum number of\
   concatenated cells configuration for a given ATM cell relay circuit.\
\
   This AVP is OPTIONAL.  If the egress LCCE is configured with a\
   maximum number of cells to be concatenated by the ingress LCCE, it\
   SHOULD signal this value to the ingress LCCE.\

\
7.  OAM Emulation Required AVP\
\
   An "OAM Emulation Required AVP", Attribute Type 87, MAY be needed to\
   signal OAM emulation in AAL5 SDU Mode, if an LCCE cannot support the\
   transport of OAM cells across L2TP sessions.  If OAM cell emulation\
   is configured or detected via some other means on one side, the other\
   LCCE MUST support OAM cell emulation as well.\
\
   This AVP is exchanged during session negotiation (in ICRQ and ICRP)\
   or during the life of the session via SLI control messages.  If the\
   other LCCE cannot support the OAM cell emulation, the associated L2TP\
   session MUST be torn down via CDN message with result code 22.\
\
   OAM Emulation AVP is a boolean AVP, having no Attribute Value.  Its\
   absence is FALSE and its presence is TRUE.  This AVP MAY be hidden\
   (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this AVP SHOULD be set to\
   0, but MAY vary (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3931]).  The Length (before\
   hiding) of this AVP is 6.\
\
8.  ATM Defects Mapping and Status Notification\
\
   ATM OAM alarms or circuit status is indicated via the Circuit Status\
   AVP as defined in Section 5.4.5 of [RFC3931].  For reference, usage\
   of this AVP is shown below.\
\
    0                   1\

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\
\
   The Value is a 16-bit mask with the two least significant bits\
   defined, and the remaining bits are reserved for future use.\
   Reserved bits MUST be set to 0 when sending and ignored upon receipt.\
\
   The A (Active) bit indicates whether the ATM circuit is ACTIVE (1) or\
   INACTIVE (0).\
\
   The N (New) bit indicates whether the ATM circuit status indication\
   is for a new ATM circuit (1) or an existing ATM circuit (0).\
\
8.1.  ATM Alarm Status AVP\
\
   An "ATM Alarm Status AVP", Attribute Type 88, indicates the reason\
   for the ATM circuit status and specific alarm type, if any, to its\
   peer LCCE node.  This OPTIONAL AVP MAY be present in the SLI message\
   with the Circuit Status AVP.\

\
   The Circuit Status Reason is a 2-octet unsigned integer, and the\
   Alarm Type is also a 2-octet unsigned integer.\
\
   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this\

   The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 10 octets.\
\
   This AVP is sent in the SLI message to indicate additional\
   information about the ATM circuit status.\
\
   Circuit Status Reason values for the SLI message are as follows:\
\
           0 - Reserved\
           1 - No alarm or alarm cleared (default for Active Status)\
           2 - Unspecified or unknown Alarm Received (default for\
               Inactive Status)\
           3 - ATM Circuit received F1 Alarm on ingress LCCE\
           4 - ATM Circuit received F2 Alarm on ingress LCCE\
           5 - ATM Circuit received F3 Alarm on ingress LCCE\
           6 - ATM Circuit received F4 Alarm on ingress LCCE\

           8 - ATM Circuit down due to ATM Port shutdown on Peer LCCE\
           9 - ATM Circuit down due to loop-back timeout on ingress LCCE\
\
   The general ATM Alarm failures are encoded as below:\

\
   ATMPWs support two modes of encapsulation: ATM AAL5-SDU Mode and ATM\
   Cell Relay Mode.  The following sections list their respective\
   characteristics in relationship to the native service.\
\
9.1.  ATM AAL5-SDU Mode\
\
   ATMPWs operating in AAL5-SDU Mode only support the transport of PVC-\
   based services.  In this mode, the AAL5 CPCS-PDU from a single VCC is\
   reassembled at the ingress LCCE, and the AAL5 CPCS-SDU (i.e., the\
   AAL5 CPCS-PDU without CPCS-PDU Trailer or PAD octets, also referred\
   to as AAL5 CPCS-PDU Payload) is transported over the Pseudowire.\
   Therefore, Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) functions are required\
   at the LCCEs.  There is a one-to-one mapping between an ATM PVC and\
   an ATMPW operating in AAL5-SDU Mode, supporting bidirectional\
   transport of variable length frames.  With the exception of\
   optionally transporting OAM cells, only ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL)\
   Type 5 frames are carried in this mode, including multiprotocol over\
   AAL5 packets [RFC2684].\
\
   The following considerations stem from ATM AAL5-SDU Mode Pseudowires\
   not transporting the ATM cell headers and AAL5 CPCS-PDU Trailer (see\
   Section 5.1):\
\
      o An ATMPW operating in AAL5-SDU Mode conveys EFCI and CLP\
        information using the G and C bits in the ATM-Specific Sublayer.\
        In consequence, the EFCI and CLP values of individual ATM cells\
        that constitute the AAL5 frame may be lost across the ATMPW, and\
        CLP and EFCI transparency may not be maintained.  The AAL5-SDU\
        Mode does not preserve EFCI and CLP values for every ATM cell\
        within the AAL5 PDU.  The processing of these bits on ingress\
        and egress is defined in Section 4.1.\
\
      o Only the least significant bit (LSB) from the CPCS-UU (User-to-\
        User indication) field in the CPCS-PDU Trailer is transported\
        using the ATM-Specific Sublayer (see Section 4.1).  This bit\
        contains the Frame Relay C/R bit when FRF.8.1 Frame Relay / ATM\
        PVC Service Interworking [FRF8.1] is used.  The CPCS-UU field is\
        not used in multiprotocol over AAL5 [RFC2684].  However,\
        applications that transfer user to user information using the\
        CPCS-UU octet would fail to operate.\

RFC 4454                    ATM over L2TPv3                     May 2006\
\
\
      o The CPI (Common Part Indicator) field in the CPCS-PDU Trailer is\
        also not transported across the ATMPW.  This does not affect\
        multiprotocol over AAL5 applications since the field is used for\
        alignment and MUST be coded as 0x00 [RFC2684].\
\
      o The trailing CRC field in the CPCS-PDU is stripped at the\
        ingress LCCE and not transported over the ATMPW operating in\
        AAL5-SDU Mode.  It is in turn regenerated at the egress LCCE.\
        Since the CRC has end-to-end significance, this means that\
        errors introduced in the ATMPW payload during encapsulation or\
        transit across the packet switched network may not be detected.\
        To allow for payload integrity checking transparency on ATMPWs\
        operating in AAL5-SDU Mode using L2TP over IP or L2TP over\
        UDP/IP, the L2TPv3 session can utilize IPsec as specified in\
        Section 4.1.3 of [RFC3931].\
\
   Some additional characteristics of the AAL5-SDU Mode are the\
   following:\
\
      o The status of the ATM PVC is signaled between LCCEs using the\
        Circuit Status AVP.  More granular cause values for the ATM\
        circuit status and specific ATM alarm types are signaled using\
        the ATM Alarm Status AVP (see Section 8.1).  Additionally, loss\
        of connectivity between LCCEs can be detected by the L2TPv3\
        keepalive mechanism (see Section 4.4 in [RFC3931]).\
\
      o F5 OAM cells' relative order with respect to user data cells may\
        not be maintained.  F5 OAM cells that arrive during the\
        reassembly of an AAL5 SDU are sent immediately over the PW and\
        before the AAL5 SDU payload.  At egress, these OAM cells are\
        sent before the cells that comprise the AAL5-SDU.  Therefore,\
        applications that rely on cell sequence integrity between OAM\
        and user data cells may not work.  This includes Performance\
        Monitoring and Security OAM cells (see Section 5.1).  In\
        addition, the AAL5-SDU service allows for OAM emulation in which\
        OAM cells are not transported over the ATMPW (see Section 7).\
        This is advantageous for AAL5-SDU Mode ATMPW implementations\
        that do not support cell transport using the T-bit.\
\
      o Fragmentation and Reassembly procedures MAY be used for managing\
        mismatched MTUs, as specified in Section 5 of [L2TPFRAG] or in\
        the underlying PSN (IP, etc.) between tunnel endpoints as\
        discussed in Section 4.1.4 of [RFC3931].  Only one of these\
        methods SHOULD be used for a given AAL5-SDU Mode ATMPW.  The\
        procedures described in [L2TPFRAG] can be used to support the\
        maximum size of an AAL5 SDU, 2 ^ 16 - 1 (65535) octets.\
        However, relying on fragmentation on the L2TP/IPv4 packet\
        between tunnel endpoints limits the maximum size of the AAL5 SDU\

\
\
        that can be transported, because the maximum total length of an\
        IPv4 datagram is already 65535 octets.  In this case, the\
        maximum AAL5 SDU that can be transported is limited to 65535\
        minus the encapsulating headers, 24-36 octets for L2TP-over-IPv4\
        or 36-48 octets for L2TP-over-UDP/IPv4.  When the AAL5 payload\
        is IPv4, an additional option is to fragment IP packets before\
        tunnel encapsulation with L2TP/IP (see Section 4.1.4 of\
        [RFC3931]).\
\
      o Sequencing may be enabled on the ATMPW using the ATM-Specific\
        Sublayer Sequence Number field, to detect lost, duplicate, or\
        out-of-order frames on a per-session basis (see Section 4.2).\
\
      o Quality of Service characteristics such as throughput (cell\
        rates), burst sizes and delay variation can be provided by\
        leveraging Quality of Service features of the LCCEs and the\
        underlying PSN, increasing the faithfulness of ATMPWs.  This\
        includes mapping ATM service categories to a compatible PSN\
        class of service.\
\
9.2.  ATM Cell Relay Mode\
\
   In this mode, no reassembly takes place at the ingress LCCE.  There\
   are no SAR requirements for LCCEs.  Instead, ATM-layer cells are\
   transported over the ATMPW.  Consequently, all AAL types can be\
   transported over ATMPWs operating in Cell Relay Mode.  ATM Cell Relay\
   Pseudowires can operate in three different modes (see Section 5.2):\
   ATM VCC, ATM VPC, and ATM Port Cell Relay Services.  The following\
   are some of their characteristics:\
\
      o The ATM cells transported over Cell Relay Mode ATMPWs consist of\
        a 4-byte ATM cell header and a 48-byte ATM cell-payload (see\
        Section 5.2).  The ATM Service Payload of a Cell Relay Mode\
        ATMPW is a multiple of 52 bytes.  The Header Error Checksum\
        (HEC) in the ATM cell header containing a Cyclic Redundancy\
        Check (CRC) calculated over the first 4 bytes of the ATM cell\
        header is not transported.  Accordingly, the HEC field may not\
        accurately reflect errors on an end-to-end basis; errors or\
        corruption in the 4-byte ATM cell header introduced in the ATMPW\
        payload during encapsulation or transit across the PSN may not\
        be detected.  To allow for payload integrity checking\
        transparency on ATMPWs operating in Cell Relay Mode using L2TP\
        over IP or L2TP over UDP/IP, the L2TPv3 session can utilize\
        IPsec as specified in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC3931].\

\
\
      o ATM PWs operating in Cell Relay Mode can transport a single ATM\
        cell or multiple concatenated cells (see Section 6).  Cell\
        concatenation improves the bandwidth efficiency of the ATMPW (by\
        decreasing the overhead) but introduces latency and delay\
        variation.\
\
      o The status of the ATM PVC is signaled between LCCEs using the\
        Circuit Status AVP.  More granular cause values for the ATM\
        circuit status and specific ATM alarm types are signaled using\
        the ATM Alarm Status AVP (see Section 8.1).  Additionally, loss\
        of connectivity between LCCEs can be detected by the L2TPv3\
        keepalive mechanism (see Section 4.4 in [RFC3931]).\
\
      o ATM OAM cells are transported in the same fashion as user cells,\
        and in the same order as they are received.  Therefore,\
        applications that rely on cell sequence integrity between OAM\
        and user data cells are not adversely affected.  This includes\
        performance management and security applications that utilize\
        OAM cells (see Section 5.3).\
\
      o The maximum number of concatenated cells is limited by the MTU\
        size of the session (see Section 5.2 and Section 6).  Therefore,\
        Fragmentation and Reassembly procedures are not used for Cell\
        Relay ATMPWs.  Concatenating cells to then fragment the\
        resulting packet defeats the purpose of cell concatenation.\
        Concatenation of cells and fragmentation act as inverse\
        functions, with additional processing but null net effect, and\
        should not be used together.\
\
      o Sequencing may be enabled on the ATMPW to detect lost,\
        duplicate, or out-of-order packets on a per-session basis (see\
        Section 4.2).\
\
      o Quality of Service characteristics such as throughput (cell\
        rates), burst sizes, and delay variation can be provided by\
        leveraging Quality of Service features of the LCCEs and the\
        underlying PSN, increasing the faithfulness of ATMPWs.  This\
        includes mapping ATM service categories to a compatible PSN\
        class of service, and mapping CLP and EFCI bits to PSN classes\
        of service.  For example, mapping a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) PVC\
        to a class of service with tight loss and delay characteristics,\
        such as an Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) if\
        the PSN is an IP DiffServ-enabled domain.  The following\
        characteristics of ATMPWs operating in Cell Relay Mode include\
        additional QoS considerations:\
\
           - ATM Cell transport VCC Pseudowires allow for mapping\
             multiple ATM VCCs to a single ATMPW.  However, a user may\

\
\
             wish to map a single ATM VCC per ATMPW to satisfy QoS\
             requirements (see Section 5.2.1).\
\
           - Cell Relay ATMPWs allow for concatenating multiple cells in\
             a single Pseudowire PDU to improve bandwidth efficiency,\
             but may introduce latency and delay variation.\
\
10.  Congestion Control\
\
   As explained in [RFC3985], the PSN carrying the PW may be subject to\
   congestion, with congestion characteristics depending on PSN type,\
   network architecture, configuration, and loading.  During congestion\
   the PSN may exhibit packet loss and packet delay variation (PDV) that\
   will impact the timing and data integrity of the ATMPW.  During\
   intervals of acute congestion, some Cell Relay ATMPWs may not be able\
   to maintain service.  The inelastic nature of some ATM services\
   reduces the risk of congestion because the rates will not expand to\
   consume all available bandwidth, but on the other hand, those ATM\
   services cannot arbitrarily reduce their load on the network to\
   eliminate congestion when it occurs.\
\
   Whenever possible, Cell Relay ATMPWs should be run over traffic-\
   engineered PSNs providing bandwidth allocation and admission control\
   mechanisms.  IntServ-enabled domains providing the Guaranteed Service\
   (GS) or DiffServ-enabled domains using Expedited Forwarding (EF) are\
   examples of traffic-engineered PSNs.  Such PSNs will minimize loss\
   and delay while providing some degree of isolation of the Cell Relay\
   ATMPW's effects from neighboring streams.\
\
   If the PSN is providing a best-effort service, then the following\
   best-effort service congestion avoidance considerations apply: Those\
   ATMPWs that carry constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate-real\
   time (VBR-rt) services across the PSN will most probably not behave\
   in a TCP-friendly manner prescribed by [RFC2914].  In the presence of\
   services that reduce transmission rate, ATMPWs carrying CBR and VBR-\
   rt traffic SHOULD be halted when acute congestion is detected, in\
   order to allow for other traffic or the network infrastructure itself\
   to continue.  ATMPWs carrying unspecified bit rate (UBR) traffic,\
   which are equivalent to best-effort IP service, need not be halted\
   during acute congestion and MAY have cells delayed or dropped by the\
   ingress PE if necessary.  ATMPWs carrying variable bit rate-non real\
   time (VBR-nrt) services may or may not behave in a TCP-friendly\
   manner, depending on the end user application, but are most likely\
   safe to continue operating, since the end-user application is\
   expected to be delay-insensitive and may also be somewhat loss-\
   insensitive.\

\
\
   LCCEs SHOULD monitor for congestion (for example, by measuring packet\
   loss or as specified in Section 6.5 of [RFC3985]) in order to ensure\
   that the ATM service may be maintained.  When severe congestion is\
   detected (for example, when enabling sequencing and detecting that\
   the packet loss is higher than a threshold), the ATM service SHOULD\
   be terminated by tearing down the L2TP session via a CDN message.\
   The PW may be restarted by manual intervention, or by automatic means\
   after an appropriate waiting time.\
\
11.  Security Considerations\
\
   ATM over L2TPv3 is subject to the security considerations defined in\
   [RFC3931].  There are no additional considerations specific to\
   carrying ATM that are not present carrying other data link types.\
\
12.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The signaling mechanisms defined in this document rely upon the\
   allocation of the following ATM Pseudowire Types (see Pseudowire\
   Capabilities List as defined in 5.4.3 of [RFC3931] and L2TPv3\

RFC 4458                   SIP Voicemail URI                  April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Many applications such as Unified Messaging (UM) systems and\
   Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) systems have been developed out\
   of traditional telephony.  They can be used for storing and\
   interacting with voice, video, faxes, email, and instant messaging\
   services.  Users often use SIP to initiate communications with these\
   applications.  When a SIP call is routed to an application, it is\
   necessary that the application be able to obtain several bits of\
   information from the session initiation message so that it can\
   deliver the desired services.\
\
   For the purpose of this document, we will use UM as the main example,\
   but other applications may use the mechanism defined in this\
   document.  The UM needs to know what mailbox should be used and\
   possible reasons for the type of service desired from the UM.  Many\
   voicemail systems provide different greetings depending whether the\
   call went to voicemail because the user was busy or because the user\
   did not answer.  All of this information can be delivered in existing\
   SIP signaling from the call control that retargets the call to the\
   UM, but there are no conventions for describing how the desired\
   mailbox and the service requested are expressed.  It would be\
   possible for every vendor to make this configurable so that any site\
   could get it to work; however, this approach is unrealistic for\
   achieving interoperability among call control, gateway, and unified\
   messaging systems from different vendors.  This specification\
   describes a convention for describing this mailbox and service\
   information in the SIP URI so that vendors and operators can build\
   interoperable systems.\
\
   If there were no need to interoperate with Time Division Multiplexing\
   (TDM)-based voicemail systems or to allow TDM systems to use VoIP\
   unified messaging systems, this problem would be a little easier to\
   solve.  The problem that is introduced in the Voice over IP (VoIP) to\
   TDM case is as follows.  The SIP system needs to tell a Public\
   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateway both the subscriber's\
   mailbox identifier (which typically looks like a phone number) and\
   the address of the voicemail system in the TDM network (again a phone\
   number).\
\
   The question has been asked why the To header cannot be used to\
   specify which mailbox to use.  One problem is that the call control\
   proxies cannot modify the To header, and the User Agent Clients\
   (UACs) often set it incorrectly because they do not have information\
   about the subscribers in the domain they are trying to call.  This\
   happens because the routing of the call often translates the URI\
   multiple times before it results in an identifier for the desired\
   user that is valid in the namespace that the UM system understands.\

\
\
2.  Mechanism (User Agent Server and Proxy)\
\
   The mechanism works by encoding the information for the desired\
   service in the SIP Request-URI that is sent to the UM system.  Two\
   chunks of information are encoded, the first being the target mailbox\
   to use and the second being the SIP status code that caused this\
   retargeting and that indicates the desired service.  The userinfo and\
   hostport parts of the Request-URI will identify the voicemail\
   service, the target mailbox can be put in the target parameter, and\
   the reason can be put in the cause parameter.  For example, if the\
   proxy wished to use Bob's mailbox because his phone was busy, the URI\
   sent to the UM system could be something like:\
\
     sip:voicemail@example.com;target=bob%40example.com;cause=486\
\
2.1.  Target\
\
   Target is a URI parameter that indicates the address of the\
   retargeting entity: in the context of UM, this can be the mailbox\
   number.  For example, in the case of a voicemail system on the PSTN,\
   the user portion will contain the phone number of the voicemail\
   system, while the target will contain the phone number of the\
   subscriber's mailbox.\
\
2.2.  Cause\
\
   Cause is a URI parameter that is used to indicate the service that\
   the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message should perform.\
   The following values for this URI parameter are defined:\
\
\
                +---------------------------------+-------+\
                | Redirecting Reason              | Value |\
                +---------------------------------+-------+\
                | Unknown/Not available           | 404   |\
                | User busy                       | 486   |\
                | No reply                        | 408   |\
                | Unconditional                   | 302   |\
                | Deflection during alerting      | 487   |\
                | Deflection immediate response   | 480   |\
                | Mobile subscriber not reachable | 503   |\
                +---------------------------------+-------+\
\
   The mapping to PSTN protocols is important both for gateways that\
   connect the IP network to existing TDM customer's equipment, such as\
   Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs) and voicemail systems, and for\
   gateways that connect the IP network to the PSTN network.  Integrated\
   Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) has signaling encodings for\

RFC 4458                   SIP Voicemail URI                  April 2006\
\
\
   this information that can be treated as roughly equivalent for the\
   purposes here.  For this reason, this specification uses the names of\
   Redirecting Reason values defined in ITU-T Q.732.2-5 [8].  In this\
   specification, the Redirecting Reason Values are referred to as\
   "Causes".  It should be understood that the term "Cause" has nothing\
   to do with PSTN "Cause values" (as per ITU-T Q.850 [9] and RFC 3398\
   [5]) but are instead mapped to ITU-T Q.732.2-5 Redirecting Reasons.\
   Since ISUP interoperates with other PSTN networks, such as Q.931 [10]\
   and QSIG [11], using well-known rules, it makes sense to use the ISUP\
   names as the most appropriate superset.  If no appropriate mapping to\
   a cause value defined in this specification exists in a network, it\
   would be mapped to 302 "Unconditional".  Similarly, if the mapping\
   occurs from one of the causes defined in this specification to a PSTN\
   system that does not have an equivalent reason value, it would be\
   mapped to that network's equivalent of "Unconditional".  If a new\
   cause parameter needs to be defined, this specification will have to\
   be updated.\
\
   The user portion of the URI SHOULD be used as the address of the\
   voicemail system on the PSTN, while the target SHOULD be mapped to\
   the original redirecting number on the PSTN side.\
\
   The redirection counters SHOULD be set to one unless additional\
   information is available.\
\
2.3.  Retrieving Messages\
\
   The UM system MAY use the fact that the From header is the same as\
   the URI target as a hint that the user wishes to retrieve messages.\
\
3.  Interaction with Request History Information\
\
   The Request History mechanism [6] provides more information relating\
   to multiple retargetings.  It is reasonable to have systems in which\
   both the information in this specification and the History\
   information are included and one or both are used.\
\
   History-Info specifies a means of providing the UAS and UAC with\
   information about the retargeting of a request.  This information\
   includes the initial Request-URI and any retarget-to URIs.  This\
   information is placed in the History-Info header field, which, except\
   where prevented by privacy considerations, is built up as the request\
   progresses and, upon reaching the UAS, is returned in certain\
   responses.\
\
   History-Info, when deployed at relevant SIP entities, is intended to\
   provide a comprehensive trace of retargeting for a SIP request, along\
   with the SIP response codes that led to retargeting.\
\
\
\
Jennings, et al.             Informational                      [Page 5]\
\
RFC 4458                   SIP Voicemail URI                  April 2006\
\
\
   History-Info can complement this specification.  In particular, when\
   a proxy inserts a URI containing the parameters defined in this\
   specification into the Request-URI of a forwarded request, the proxy\
   can also insert a History-Info header field entry into the forwarded\
   request, and the URI in that entry will incorporate these parameters.\
   Therefore, even if the Request-URI is replaced as a result of\
   rerouting by a downstream proxy, the History-Info header field will\
   still contain these parameters, which may be of use to the UAS.\
   Consequently, UASes that make use of this information may find the\
   information in the History-Info header and/or in the Request-URI,\
   depending on the capability of the proxy to support generation of\
   History-Info or on the behavior of downstream proxies; therefore,\
   applications need to take this into account.\
\
4.  Limitations of Voicemail URI\
\
   This specification requires the proxy that is requesting the service\
   to understand whether the UM system it is targeting supports the\
   syntax defined in this specification.  Today, this information is\
   provided to the proxy by configuration.  For practical purposes, this\
   means that the approach is unlikely to work in cases in which the\
   proxy is not configured with information about the UM system or in\
   which the UM is not in the same administrative domain.\
\
   This approach only works when the service that the call control wants\
   applied is fairly simple.  For example, it does not allow the proxy\
   to express information like "Do not offer to connect to the target's\
   colleague because that address has already been tried".\
\
   The limitations discussed in this section are addressed by History-\
   Info [6].\
\
5.  Syntax\
\
   The ABNF[4] grammar for these parameters is shown below.  The\
   definitions of pvalue and Status-Code are defined in the ABNF in RFC\
   3261[1].\
\
     target-param      =  "target" EQUAL pvalue\
\
     cause-param       =  "cause" EQUAL Status-Code\
\
   Note that the ABNF requires some characters to be escaped if they\
   occur in the value of the target parameters.  For example, the "@"\
   character needs to be escaped.\

\
\
6.  Examples\
\
   This section provides some example use cases for the solution\
   proposed in this document.  For the purpose of this document, UM is\
   used as the main example, but other applications may use this\
   mechanism.  The examples are intended to highlight the potential\
   applicability of this solution and are not intended to limit its\
   applicability.\
\
   Also, the examples show just service retargeting on busy, but can\
   easily be adapted to show other forms of retargeting.\
\
   In several of the examples, the URIs are broken across more than one\
   line.  This was only done for formatting and is not a valid SIP\
   message.  Some of the characters in the URIs are not correctly\
   escaped to improve readability.  The examples are all shown using\
   sip: with UDP transport, for readability.  It should be understood\
   that using sips: with TLS transport is preferable.\
\
6.1.  Proxy Forwards Busy to Voicemail\
\
   In this example, Alice calls Bob.  Bob's proxy determines that Bob is\
   busy, and the proxy forwards the call to Bob's voicemail.  Alice's\
   phone is at 192.0.2.1, while Bob's phone is at 192.0.2.2.  The\
   important thing to note is the URI in message F7.\

6.2.  Endpoint Forwards Busy to Voicemail\
\
   In this example, Alice calls Bob.  Bob is busy, but forwards the\
   session directly to his voicemail.  Alice's phone is at 192.0.2.1,\
   while Bob's phone is at 192.0.2.2.  The important thing to note is\
   the URI in the Contact in message F3.\

6.3.  Endpoint Forwards Busy to TDM via a Gateway\
\
   In this example, the voicemail is reached via a gateway to a TDM\
   network.  Bob's number is +1 555 555-1002, while voicemail's number\
   on the TDM network is +1-555-555-2000.\
\
   The call flow is the same as in Section 6.2 except for the Contact\
   URI in F4 and the Request URI in F7.\

6.5.  Zero Configuration UM System\
\
   In this example, the UM system has no configuration information\
   specific to any user.  The proxy is configured to pass a URI that\
   provides the prompt to play and an email address in the user portion\
   of the URI to which the recorded message is to be sent.\
\
   The call flow is the same as in Section 6.1, except that the URI in\
   F7 changes to specify the user part as Bob's email address, and the\
   Netann [7] URI play parameter specifies where the greeting to play\
   can be fetched from.\

    Content-Length: *Body length goes here*\
\
    * SDP goes here*\
\
   In addition, if the proxy wished to indicate a Voice XML (VXML)\
   script that the UM should execute, it could add a parameter to the\
   URI in the above message that looked like:\
\
    voicexml=http://www.example.com/bob/busy.vxml\
\
6.6.  Call Coverage\
\
   In a Call Coverage example, a user on the PSTN calls an 800 number.\
   The gateway sends this to the proxy, which recognizes that the\
   helpdesk is the target.  Alice and Bob are staffing the help desk and\
   are tried sequentially, but neither answers, so the call is forwarded\
   to the helpdesk's voicemail.\
\
   The details of this flow are trivial and not shown.  The key item in\
   this example is that the INVITE to Alice and Bob looks as follows:\
\
     INVITE sip:voicemail@example.com;target=helpdesk%40example.com;\\\
            cause=302 SIP/2.0\

RFC 4458                   SIP Voicemail URI                  April 2006\
\
\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document discusses transactions involving at least three\
   parties, which increases the complexity of the privacy issues.\
\
   The new URI parameters defined in this document are generally sent\
   from a Proxy or call control system to a Unified Messaging (UM)\
   system or to a gateway to the PSTN and then to a voicemail system.\
   These new parameters tell the UM what service the proxy wishes to\
   have performed.  Just as any message sent from the proxy to the UM\
   needs to be integrity protected, these messages need to be integrity\
   protected to stop attackers from, for example, causing a voicemail\
   meant for a company's CEO to go to an attacker's mailbox.  RFC 3261\
   provides a TLS mechanism suitable for performing this integrity\
   protection.\
\
   The signaling from the Proxy to the UM or gateway will reveal who is\
   calling whom and possibly some information about a user's presence\
   based on whether the call was answered or sent to voicemail.  This\
   information can be protected by encrypting the SIP traffic between\
   the Proxy and UM or gateway.  Again, RFC 3261 contains mechanisms for\
   accomplishing this using TLS.\
\
   Implementations should implement and use TLS.\
\
8.1.  Integrity Protection of Forwarding in SIP\
\
   The forwarding of a call in SIP brings up a very strange trust issue.\
   Consider the normal case -- A calls B and the call gets forwarded to\
   C by a network element in B's domain, and then C answers the call.  A\
   has called B but ended up talking to C.  This scenario may be hard to\
   separate from a man-in-the-middle attack.\
\
   There are two possible solutions.  One is that B sends back\
   information to A saying don't call me, call C, and signs it as B.\
   The problem is that this solution involves revealing that B has\
   forwarded to C, which B often may not want to do.  For example, B may\
   be a work phone that has been forwarded to a mobile or home phone.\
   The user does not want to reveal their mobile or home phone number\
   but, even more importantly, does not want to reveal that they are not\
   in the office.\
\
   The other possible solution is that A needs to trust B only to\
   forward to a trusted identity.  This requires a hop-by-hop transitive\
   trust such that each hop will only send to a trusted next hop and\
   each hop will only do things that the user at that hop desired.  This\
\

RFC 4458                   SIP Voicemail URI                  April 2006\
\
\
   solution is enforced in SIP using the SIPS URI and TLS-based\
   hop-by-hop security.  It protects from an off-axis attack, but if one\
   of the hops is not trustworthy, the call may be diverted to an\
   attacker.\
\
   Any redirection of a call to an attacker's mailbox is serious.  It is\
   trivial for an attacker to make its mailbox seem very much like the\
   real mailbox and forward the messages to the real mailbox so that the\
   fact that the messages have been intercepted or even tampered with\
   escapes detection.  Approaches such as the SIPS URL and the\
   History-Info[6] can help protect against these attacks.\
\
8.2.  Privacy Related Issues on the Second Call Leg\
\
   In the case where A calls B and gets redirected to C, occasionally\
   people suggest that there is a requirement for the call leg from B to\
   C to be anonymous.  The SIP case is not the PSTN, and there is no\
   call leg from B to C; instead, there is a VoIP session between A and\
   C.  If A has put a To header field value containing B in the initial\
   invite message, unless something special is done about it, C would\
   see that To header field value.  If the person who answers phone C\
   says "I think you dialed the wrong number; who were you trying to\
   reach?", A will probably specify B.\
\
   If A does not want C to see that the call was to B, A needs a special\
   relationship with the forwarding Proxy to induce it not to reveal\
   that information.  The call should go through an anonymization\
   service that provides session or user level privacy (as described in\
   RFC 3323 [2]) service before going to C.  It is not hard to figure\
   out how to meet this requirement, but it is unclear why anyone would\
   want this service.\
\
   The scenario in which B wants to make sure that C does not see that\
   the call was to B is easier to deal with but a bit weird.  The usual\
   argument is that Bill wants to forward his phone to Monica but does\
   not want Monica to find out his phone number.  It is hard to imagine\
   that Monica would want to accept all Bill's calls without knowing how\
   to call Bill to complain.  The only person Monica will be able to\
   complain to is Hillary, when she tries to call Bill.  Several popular\
   web portals will send SMS alert messages about things like stock\
   prices and weather to mobile phone users today.  Some of these\
   contain no information about the account on the web portal that\
   initiated them, making it nearly impossible for the mobile phone\
   owner to stop them.  This anonymous message forwarding has turned out\
   to be a really bad idea even where no malice is present.  Clearly\
   some people are fairly dubious about the need for this, but never\
   mind: let's look at how it is solved.\

\
\
   In the general case, the proxy needs to route the call through an\
   anonymization service and everything will be cleaned up.  Any\
   anonymization service that performs the "Privacy: Header" Service in\
   RFC 3323 [2] must remove the cause and target URI parameters from the\
   URI.  Privacy of the parameters, when they form part of a URI within\
   the History-Info header, is covered in History-Info [6].\
\
   This specification does not discuss the security considerations of\
   mapping to a PSTN Gateway.  Security implications of mapping to ISUP,\
   for example, are discussed in RFC 3398 [5].\

RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document defines the "info" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\
   scheme for information assets that have identifiers in public\
   namespaces but are not part of the URI allocation.  By "information\
   asset" this document intends any information construct that has\
   identity within a public namespace.\
\
1.1.  Terminology\
\
   In this document, the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL\
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "MAY NOT", and "RECOMMENDED" are\
   to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate\
   requirement levels for compliant implementations.\
\
1.2.  Information Assets\
\
   There exist many information assets with identifiers in public\
   namespaces that are not referenceable by URI schemes.  Examples of\
   such namespaces include Dewey Decimal Classifications [DEWEY],\
   Library of Congress Control Numbers [LCCN], NISO Serial Item and\
   Contribution Identifiers [SICI], NASA Astrophysics Data System\
   Bibcodes [BIBCODE], and National Library of Medicine PubMed\
   identifiers [PMID].  Other candidate namespaces include Online\
   Computer Library Center OCLC Numbers [OCLCNUM] and NISO OpenURL\
   Framework identifiers [OFI].\
\
   The "info" URI scheme facilitates the referencing of information\
   assets that have identifiers in such public namespaces by means of\
   URIs.  When referencing an information asset by means of its "info"\
   URI, the asset SHALL be considered a "resource" as defined in RFC\
   3986 [RFC3986] and SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic,\
   and shared language benefits that the URI presentation confers.  As\
   such, the "info" URI scheme enables public namespaces that are not\
   part of the URI allocation to be represented within the allocation.\
   The "info" URI scheme thus provides a bridging mechanism to allow\
   public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation.\
\
   Namespaces declared under the "info" URI scheme are regulated by an\
   "info" Registry mechanism.  The "info" Registry allows a public\
   namespace that is not part of the URI allocation to be declared in a\
   registration process by the organization that manages it (the\
   Namespace Authority).  The "info" Registry supports the declaration\
   of public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation in a\
   manner that facilitates the construction of URIs for information\
   assets without imposing the burdens of independent URI registration\
   and maintenance of resource representations on the Namespace\
   Authority.  Information assets identified within a registered\

RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
   namespace SHALL be added or deleted according to the business\
   processes of the Namespace Authority, and yet MAY be referenced\
   within network applications via the "info" URI in an open,\
   standardized way without additional action on the part of the\
   Namespace Authority.\
\
   The "info" URI scheme exists primarily for identification purposes.\
   Implementations MUST NOT assume that an "info" URI can be\
   dereferenced to a representation of the resource identified by the\
   URI although Namespace Authorities MAY disclose in the registration\
   record references to service mechanisms pertaining to identifiers\
   from the registered namespace.  Applications of the "info" URI scheme\
   are restricted to the identification of information assets and the\
   declaration of normalization rules for comparing identifiers of such\
   information assets regardless of whether any services relating to\
   such information assets are accessible via the Internet.  References\
   to such services MAY be disclosed within an "info" registration\
   record, but these services SHALL NOT be regarded as authoritative.\
   The "info" URI scheme does not support global resolution methods.\
\
2.  Application of the "info" URI Scheme\
\
   Public namespaces that are used for the identification of information\
   assets and that are not part of the URI allocation MAY be registered\
   as namespaces within the "info" Registry.  Namespace Authorities MAY\
   register these namespaces in the "info" Registry, thereby making\
   these namespaces available to applications that need to reference\
   information assets by means of a URI.  Registrations of public\
   namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation by parties other\
   than the Namespace Authority SHALL NOT be permitted, thereby ensuring\
   against hostile usurpation or inappropriate usage of registered\
   service marks or the public namespaces of others.\
\
   Registration of a public namespace under the "info" Registry implies\
   no particular functionalities of the identifiers from the registered\
   namespace other than the identification of information assets.  No\
   resolution mechanisms can be assumed for the "info" URI scheme,\
   though for any particular namespace there MAY exist mechanisms for\
   resolving identifiers to network services.  The definition of such\
   services falls outside the scope of the "info" URI scheme.\
   Registration does not define namespace-specific semantics for\
   identifiers within a registered namespace, though allowable character\
   sets and normalization rules are specified in Sections 4 and 5 so as\
   to ensure that the URIs created using such identifiers are compliant\
   with applications that use URIs.\

RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
   The registration of a public namespace in the "info" Registry SHALL\
   NOT preclude further development of services associated with that\
   namespace that MAY qualify the namespace for additional publication\
   elsewhere within the URI allocation.\
\
3.  The "info" Registry\
\
   The "info" Registry provides a mechanism for the registration of\
   public namespaces that are used for the identification of information\
   assets and that are not part of the URI allocation.\
\
   NISO [NISO], the National Information Standards Organization, will\
   act as the Maintenance Agency for the "info" Registry and will\
   delegate the day-to-day operation of the "info" Registry to a\
   Registry Operator.  As the Maintenance Agency, NISO will ensure that\
   the Registry Operator operates the "info" Registry in accordance with\
   a publicly articulated policy document established under NISO\
   governance and made available on the "info" website,\
   <http://info-uri.info/>.  The "info" Registry policy defines a review\
   process for candidate namespaces and provides measures of quality\
   control and suitability for entry of namespaces.\
\
3.1.  Management Characteristics of the "info" Registry\
\
   The "info" Registry will be managed according to policies established\
   under the auspices of NISO.  All such policies, as well as the\
   namespace declarations in the "info" Registry, will be public.\
\
3.2.  Functional Characteristics of the "info" Registry\
\
   The "info" Registry will be publicly accessible and will support\
   discovery (by both humans and machines) of:\
\
   o  string literals identifying the namespaces for which the Registry\
      provides a guarantee of uniqueness and persistence\
   o  names and contact information of Namespace Authorities\
   o  syntax requirements for identifiers maintained in such namespaces\
   o  normalization methodologies for identifiers maintained in such\
      namespaces\
   o  network references to a description of service mechanisms (if any)\
      for identifiers maintained in such namespaces\
   o  ancillary documentation\
\
   Registry entries refer to the corresponding "namespace" and\
   "identifier" components, which are defined in the ABNF given in\

3.3.  Maintenance of the "info" Registry\
\
   The public namespaces that MAY be registered in the "info" Registry\
   will be those of interest to the communities served by NISO, and\
   therefore NISO is committed to act as Maintenance Authority for the\
   "info" Registry and to assign a Registry Operator to operate it.\
\
   NISO, a non-profit association accredited by the American National\
   Standards Institute (ANSI), identifies, develops, maintains, and\
   publishes technical standards to manage information in the digital\
   environment.  NISO standards apply technologies to the full range of\
   information-related needs, including retrieval, re-purposing,\
   storage, metadata, and preservation.\
\
   Founded in 1939, incorporated as a not-for-profit education\
   association in 1983, and assuming its current name the following\
   year, NISO draws its support from the communities it serves.  The\
   leaders of over 70 organizations in the fields of publishing,\
   libraries, IT, and media serve as its voting members.  Hundreds of\
   experts and practitioners serve on NISO committees and as officers of\
   the association.\
\
   NISO has been designated by ANSI to represent US interests to the\
   International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Technical\
   Committee 46 on Information and Documentation.\
\
   The NISO headquarters office is located at 4733 Bethesda Ave.,\
   Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.  (For further information, see the NISO\

4.  The "info" URI Scheme\
\
4.1.  Definition of "info" URI Syntax\
\
   The "info" URI syntax presented in this document is conformant with\
   the generic URI syntax defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  This\
   specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of\
   RFC 4234 [RFC4234] to define the URI.  The following core ABNF\
   productions are used by this specification as defined by Appendix B.1\
   of RFC 4234: ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG.\
\
   The "info" URI syntax is presented in two parts.  Part A contains\
   productions specific to the "info" URI scheme, while Part B contains\
   generic productions from RFC 3986 [RFC3986], which are repeated here\
   both for completeness and for reference.  The following set of\
   productions (Part A) is specific to the "info" URI scheme:\

\
\
   ; Part A:\
   ; productions specific to the "info" URI scheme\
\
   info-URI        = info-scheme ":" info-identifier [ "#" fragment ]\
\
   info-scheme     = "info"\
\
   info-identifier = namespace "/" identifier\
\
   namespace       = scheme\
\
   identifier      = *( pchar / "/" )\
\
   ; Note that "info" URIs containing dot-segments (i.e., segments\
   ; whose full content consists of "." or "..") MAY NOT be suitable\
   ; for use with applications that perform dot-segment normalization\
\
   This next set of productions (Part B) are generic productions\
   reproduced from RFC 3986 [RFC3986]:\
\
   ; Part B:\
   ; generic productions from RFC 3986 [RFC3986]\
\
   scheme          = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )\
\
   pchar           = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"\
\
   fragment        = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )\
\
   unreserved      = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"\
\
   pct-encoded     = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG\
\
   sub-delims      = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"\
                        / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="\
   An "info" URI has an "info-identifier" as its scheme-specific part\
   and MAY take an optional "fragment" component.  An "info-identifier"\
   is constructed by appending an "identifier" component to a\
   "namespace" component separated by a slash "/" character.  The "info"\
   URI scheme is supportive of hierarchical processing as indicated by\
   the presence of the slash "/" character, although the slash "/"\
   character SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a strict hierarchy delimiter.\
\
   Values for the "namespace" component of the "info" URI are name\
   tokens composed of URI scheme characters only (cf. the "scheme"\
   production).  They identify the public namespace in which the\
   (unescaped) value for the "identifier" component originates, and are\
   registered in the "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness\

\
\
   and persistence.  Although the "namespace" component is\
   case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that\
   specify values for the "namespace" component SHOULD do so using\
   lowercase letters.  An implementation SHOULD accept uppercase letters\
   as equivalent to lowercase in "namespace" names, for the sake of\
   robustness, but SHOULD only generate lowercase "namespace" names, for\
   consistency.\
\
   Values for the "identifier" component of the "info" URI MAY be viewed\
   as being hierarchical strings composed of path segments built from\
   path segment characters (cf. the "pchar" production), the segments\
   being separated by slash "/" characters, although any semantic\
   interpretation of the "/" character as a hierarchy delimiter MUST NOT\
   be assumed.  In their originating public namespace, the (unescaped)\
   values for the "identifier" component identify information assets.\
   The values for the "identifier" component MUST be %-escaped as\
   required by this syntax.  The "identifier" component SHOULD be\
   treated as case-sensitive, although the "info" Registry MAY record\
   the case-sensitivity of identifiers from particular registered public\
   namespaces.  The "info" Registry MAY also disclose additional\
   normalization rules regarding the treatment of punctuation characters\
   and the like.\
\
   Values for the "fragment" component of the "info" URI are strings\
   composed of path segment characters (cf. the "pchar" production) plus\
   the slash "/" character and the question mark "?" character.  No\
   semantic role is assigned to the slash "/" character and the question\
   mark "?" character within the "fragment" component.  The (unescaped)\
   values for the "fragment" component identify secondary information\
   assets with respect to the primary information asset, which is\
   referenced by the "info-identifier".  The values for the "fragment"\
   component MUST be %-escaped as required by this syntax.  The\
   "fragment" component MUST be treated as being case-sensitive.\
\
4.2.  Allowed Characters Under the "info" URI Scheme\
\
   The "info" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII\
   characters as specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] for a generic URI.  An\
   "info" URI string SHOULD be represented as a Unicode [UNICODE] string\
   and be encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629] form.  Reserved characters as well\
   as excluded US-ASCII characters and non-US-ASCII characters MUST be\
   %-escaped before forming the URI.  Details of the %-escape encoding\
   can be found in RFC 3986 [RFC3986], Section 2.4.\

\
4.3.  Examples of "info" URIs\
\
   Some examples of syntactically valid "info" URIs are given below:\
\
       a) info:ddc/22/eng//004.678\
\
   where "ddc" is the "namespace" component for a Dewey Decimal\
   Classification [DEWEY] namespace and "22/eng//004.678" is the\
   "identifier" component for an identifier of an information asset\
   within that namespace.\
\
   The information asset identified by the identifier "22/eng//004.678"\
   in the namespace for (22nd Ed.)  English-language Dewey Decimal\
   Classifications is the classification\
\
       "Internet"\
\
\
       b) info:lccn/2002022641\
\
   where "lccn" is the "namespace" component for a Library of Congress\
   Control Number [LCCN] namespace and "2002022641" is the "identifier"\
   component for an identifier of an information asset within that\
   namespace.\
\
   The information asset identified by the identifier "2002022641" in\
   the namespace for Library of Congress Control Numbers is the metadata\
   record\

       "Newcomer, Eric. Understanding Web services: XML, WSDL,\
       SOAP, and UDDI. Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2002."\
\
\
       c) info:sici/0363-0277(19950315)120:5%3C%3E1.0.TX;2-V\
\
   where "sici" is the "namespace" component for a Serial Item and\
   Contribution Identifier [SICI] namespace and\
   "0363-0277(19950315)120:5%3C%3E1.0.TX;2-V" is the "identifier"\
   component for an identifier of an information asset in that namespace\
   in %-escaped form, or in unescaped form\
   "0363-0277(19950315)120:5<>1.0.TX;2-V".\
\
   The information asset identified by the identifier\
   "0363-0277(19950315)120:5<>1.0.TX;2-V" in the namespace for Serial\
   Item and Contribution Identifiers is the journal issue\

       d) <rdf:Description about="info:bibcode/2003Icar..163..263Z"/>\
\
   where "bibcode" is the "namespace" component for a NASA Astrophysics\
   Data System (ADS) Bibcode [BIBCODE] namespace and\
   "2003Icar..163..263Z" is the "identifier" component for an identifier\
   of an information asset within that namespace.  This example further\
   shows an application of an "info" URI as the subject of a Resource\
   Description Framework (RDF) statement.\
\
   The information asset identified by the identifier\
   "2003Icar..163..263Z" in the namespace for NASA ADS Bibcodes is the\
   metadata record in the ADS system that describes the journal article\

       "K. Zahnle, P. Schenk, H. Levison and L. Dones, Cratering rates\
       in the outer Solar System, Icarus, 163 (2003) pp. 263-289."\
\
\
       e) info:pmid/12376099\
\
   where "pmid" is the "namespace" component for a PubMed Identifier\
   [PMID] namespace and "12376099" is the "identifier" component for an\
   identifier of an information asset in that namespace.\
\
   The information asset identified by the identifier "12376099" in the\
   namespace for PubMed Identifiers is the metadata record in the PubMed\
   database that describes the journal article\

       of the principal promoter for human tenascin-X. Genomics. 2002\
       Oct;80(4):443-52."\
\
5.  Normalization and Comparison of "info" URIs\
\
   In order to facilitate comparison of "info" URIs, a sequence of\
   normalization steps SHOULD be applied as detailed below.  After\
   normalizing the URI strings, comparison of two "info" URIs is then\
   applied on a character-by-character basis as prescribed by RFC 3986\
   [RFC3986], Section 6.2.1.\
\
   The following generic normalization steps SHOULD anyway be applied by\
   applications processing "info" URIs:\
\
        a) Normalize the case of the "scheme" component to be\
           lowercase\
        b) Normalize the case of the "namespace" component to be\
           lowercase\
        c) Unescape all unreserved %-escaped characters in the\
           "namespace" and "identifier" components\

RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
        d) Normalize the case of any %-escaped characters in the\
           "namespace" and "identifier" components to be\
           uppercase\
\
   Further normalization steps MAY be applied by applications to "info"\
   URIs based on rules recorded in the "info" Registry for a registered\
   public namespace, but such normalization steps remain outside of the\
   scope of the "info" URI definition.\
\
   Since the "info" URI SHOULD be treated as being case-sensitive, a\
   canonical form MAY only be arrived at by consulting the "info"\
   Registry for possible information on the case-sensitivity for\
   identifiers from a registered public namespace, and any case\
   normalization step to apply.  The "info" Registry MAY also disclose\
   additional normalization rules regarding the treatment of punctuation\
   characters and the like.\
\
   In cases, however, where no single canonical form of the "identifier"\
   component exists, it is nevertheless RECOMMENDED that a Namespace\
   Authority nominate a preferred form, which SHOULD be used wherever\
   possible within an "info" URI so that applications MAY have an\
   increased chance of successful comparison of two "info" URIs.\
\
   Note that "info" URIs containing dot-segments (i.e., segments whose\
   full content consists of "." or "..") MAY NOT be suitable for use\
   with applications that perform dot-segment normalization.\
\
   The following unnormalized forms of an "info" URI\
\
       U1. INFO:PII/S0888-7543(02)96852-7\
       U2. info:PII/S0888754302968527\
       U3. info:pii/S0888%2D7543%2802%2996852%2D7\
       U4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7\
\
   are normalized to the following respective forms\
\
       N1. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7\
       N2. info:pii/S0888754302968527\

       N4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7\
\
   The "info" URI definition does not prescribe further normalization\
   steps, although applications MAY apply additional normalization steps\
   according to any rules recorded in the "info" Registry for a\
   registered public namespace.\

RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
6.  Rationale\
\
6.1.  Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public\
      Namespaces?\
\
   Under RFC 4395, "Guidelines and Registration Procedures for New URI\
   Schemes" [RFC4395], it is stated in Section 2.1 "Demonstrable, New,\
   Long-Lived Utility" that "New URI schemes SHOULD have clear utility\
   to the broad Internet community, beyond that available with already\
   registered URI schemes".  The "info" URI scheme allows identifiers\
   within public namespaces, used for the identification of information\
   assets, to be referred to within the URI allocation.  Once a\
   namespace is registered in the "info" Registry, the "info" URI scheme\
   enables an information asset with an identifier in that namespace to\
   be referenced by means of a URI.  As a result, the information asset\
   SHALL be considered a resource as defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] and\
   SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic, and shared language\
   benefits that the URI presentation confers.\
\
6.2.  Why Not Use an Existing URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public\
      Namespaces?\
\
   Existing URI schemes are not suitable for employment as the "info"\
   URI scheme admits of no global dereference mechanism.  While examples\
   of resource identifiers minted under other URI schemes MAY not always\
   be dereferenceable, nevertheless there is always a common expectation\
   that such URIs can be dereferenced by various resolution mechanisms,\
   whether they be location-dependent or location-independent resource\
   identifiers.  The "info" URI scheme applies to a class of resource\
   identifiers whose Namespace Authorities MAY or MAY NOT choose to\
   disclose service mechanisms.  Nevertheless, Namespace Authorities are\
   encouraged to disclose in the "info" registration record references\
   to any such service mechanisms in order to provide a greater utility\
   to network applications.\
\
6.3.  Why Not Create a New URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public\
      Namespaces?\
\
   RFC 2141 [RFC2141] states that "Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are\
   intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource\
   identifiers".  The "info" URI scheme, on the other hand, does not\
   assert the persistence of the identifiers created under this scheme\
   but rather of the public namespaces grandfathered under this scheme.\
   It exists primarily to disclose the identity of information assets\
   and to facilitate a lightweight registration mechanism for public\
   namespaces of identifiers managed according to the policies and\
   business models of the Namespace Authorities.  The "info" URI scheme\
   is neutral with respect to identifier persistence.  Moreover, for\
\
\
\
Van de Sompel, et al.        Informational                     [Page 12]\
\
RFC 4452                 The "info" URI Scheme                April 2006\
\
\
   "info" to operate as a URN Network Identifier (NID) would require\
   that "info" be constituted as a delegated naming authority.  It is\
   not clear that a URN NID would be an appropriate choice for naming\
   authority delegation.\
\
   Further, the "info" URI scheme is not globally dereferenceable in\
   contrast to the specific recommendation given in RFC 1737,\
   "Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names" [RFC1737] that\
   "It is strongly recommended that there be a mapping between the names\
   generated by each naming authority and URLs".  Individual Namespace\
   Authorities registered in the "info" Registry MAY, however, disclose\
   references to service mechanisms and are encouraged to do so.\
\
   An extra consideration is that the "urn" URI syntax explicitly\
   excludes generic URI hierarchy by reserving the slash "/" character.\
   An "info" URI, on the other hand, admits of hierarchical processing,\
   while remaining neutral with respect to supporting actual hierarchy,\
   and thus allows the slash "/" character (as well as more liberally\
   allowing the ampersand "&" and tilde "~" characters).  It therefore\
   represents a lower barrier to entry for Namespace Authorities in\
   keeping with its intention of acting as a bridging mechanism to allow\
   public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation.  In sum, an\
   "info" URI is more widely supportive of "human transcribability" as\
   discussed in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] than is a "urn" URI.\
\
   Additionally, the "urn" URI syntax does not support "fragment"\
   components as does the "info" URI syntax for indirect identification\
   of secondary resources.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The "info" URI scheme syntax is subject to the same security\
   considerations as the generic URI syntax described in RFC 3986\
   [RFC3986].\
\
   While some "info" Namespace Authorities MAY choose to disclose\
   service mechanisms, any security considerations resulting from the\
   execution of such services fall outside the scope of this document.\
   It is strongly recommended that the registration record of an "info"\
   namespace include any such considerations.\

8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The IANA registry for URI schemes\
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html> SHOULD be updated\
   to include an entry for the "info" URI scheme when the "info" URI\
   scheme is accepted for publication as an RFC.  This entry SHOULD\
   contain the following values:\

Abstract\
\
   Tunneling techniques such as IP-in-IP when deployed in the middle of\
   the network, typically between routers, have certain issues regarding\
   how large packets can be handled: whether such packets would be\
   fragmented and reassembled (and how), whether Path MTU Discovery\
   would be used, or how this scenario could be operationally avoided.\
   This memo justifies why this is a common, non-trivial problem, and\
   goes on to describe the different solutions and their characteristics\
   at some length.\

RFC 4459         Packet Size Issues in Network Tunnels        April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   A large number of ways to encapsulate datagrams in other packets,\
   i.e., tunneling mechanisms, have been specified over the years: for\
   example, IP-in-IP (e.g., [1] [2], [3]), Generic Routing Encapsulation\
   (GRE) [4], Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [5], or IP Security\
   (IPsec) [6] in tunnel mode -- any of which might run on top of IPv4,\
   IPv6, or some other protocol and carrying the same or a different\
   protocol.\
\
   All of these can be run so that the endpoints of the inner protocol\
   are co-located with the endpoints of the outer protocol; in a typical\
   scenario, this would correspond to "host-to-host" tunneling.  It is\
   also possible to have one set of endpoints co-located, i.e.,\
   host-to-router or router-to-host tunneling.  Finally, many of these\
   mechanisms are also employed between the routers for all or a part of\
   the traffic that passes between them, resulting in router-to-router\
   tunneling.\
\
   All these protocols and scenarios have one issue in common: how does\
   the source select the maximum packet size so that the packets will\
   fit, even encapsulated, in the smallest Maximum Transmission Unit\
   (MTU) of the traversed path in the network; and if you cannot affect\
   the packet sizes, what do you do to be able to encapsulate them in\
   any case?  The four main solutions are as follows (these will be\
   elaborated in Section 3):\
\
   1.  Fragmenting all too big encapsulated packets to fit in the paths,\
       and reassembling them at the tunnel endpoints.\
\
   2.  Signal to all the sources whose traffic must be encapsulated, and\
       is larger than fits, to send smaller packets, e.g., using Path\
       MTU Discovery (PMTUD)[7][8].\
\
   3.  Ensure that in the specific environment, the encapsulated packets\
       will fit in all the paths in the network, e.g., by using MTU\
       bigger than 1500 in the backbone used for encapsulation.\
\
   4.  Fragmenting the original too big packets so that their fragments\
       will fit, even encapsulated, in the paths, and reassembling them\
       at the destination nodes.  Note that this approach is only\
       available for IPv4 under certain assumptions (see Section 3.4).\
\
   It is also common to run multiple layers of encapsulation, for\
   example, GRE or L2TP over IPsec; with nested tunnels in the network,\
   the tunnel endpoints can be the same or different, and both the inner\
   and outer tunnels may have different MTU handling strategies.  In\

\
\
   particular, signalling may be a scalable option for the outer tunnel\
   or tunnels if the number of innermost tunnel endpoints is limited.\
\
   The tunneling packet size issues are relatively straightforward in\
   host-to-host tunneling or host-to-router tunneling where Path MTU\
   Discovery only needs to signal to one source node.  The issues are\
   significantly more difficult in router-to-router and certain\
   router-to-host scenarios, which are the focus of this memo.\
\
   It is worth noting that most of this discussion applies to a more\
   generic case, where there exists a link with a lower MTU in the path.\
   A concrete and widely deployed example of this is the usage of PPP\
   over Ethernet (PPPoE) [11] at the customers' access link.  These\
   lower-MTU links, and particularly PPPoE links, are typically not\
   deployed in topologies where fragmentation and reassembly might be\
   unfeasible (e.g., a backbone), so this may be a slightly easier\
   problem.  However, this more generic case is considered out of scope\
   of this memo.\
\
   There are also known challenges in specifying and implementing a\
   mechanism that would be used at the tunnel endpoint to obtain the\
   best suitable packet size to use for encapsulation: if a static value\
   is chosen, a lot of fragmentation might end up being performed.  On\
   the other hand, if PMTUD is used, the implementation would need to\
   update the discovered interface MTU based on the ICMP Packet Too Big\
   messages and originate ICMP Packet Too Big message(s) back to the\
   source(s) of the encapsulated packets; this also assumes that\
   sufficient data has been piggybacked on the ICMP messages (beyond the\
   required 64 bits after the IPv4 header).  We'll discuss using PMTUD\
   to signal the sources briefly in Section 3.2, but in-depth\
   specification and analysis are described elsewhere (e.g., in [4] and\
   [2]) and are out of scope of this memo.\
\
   Section 2 includes a problem statement, section 3 describes the\
   different solutions with their drawbacks and advantages, and section\
   4 presents conclusions.\
\
2.  Problem Statement\
\
   It is worth considering why exactly this is considered a problem.\
\
   It is possible to fix all the packet size issues using solution 1,\
   fragmenting the resulting encapsulated packet, and reassembling it by\
   the tunnel endpoint.  However, this is considered problematic for at\
   least three reasons, as described in Section 3.1.\
\
   Therefore, it is desirable to avoid fragmentation and reassembly if\
   possible.  On the other hand, the other solutions may not be\

\
\
   practical either: especially in router-to-router or router-to-host\
   tunneling, Path MTU Discovery might be very disadvantageous --\
   consider the case where a backbone router would send ICMP Packet Too\
   Big messages to every source that would try to send packets through\
   it.  Fragmenting before encapsulation is also not available in IPv6,\
   and not available when the Don't Fragment (DF) bit has been set (see\
   Section 3.4 for more).  Ensuring a high enough MTU so encapsulation\
   is always possible is of course a valid approach, but requires\
   careful operational planning, and may not be a feasible assumption\
   for implementors.\
\
   This yields that there is no trivial solution to this problem, and it\
   needs to be further explored to consider the trade offs, as is done\
   in this memo.\
\
3.  Description of Solutions\
\
   This section describes the potential solutions in a bit more detail.\
\
3.1.  Fragmentation and Reassembly by the Tunnel Endpoints\
\
   The seemingly simplest solution to tunneling packet size issues is\
   fragmentation of the outer packet by the encapsulator and reassembly\
   by the decapsulator.  However, this is highly problematic for at\
   least three reasons:\
\
   o  Fragmentation causes overhead: every fragment requires the IP\
      header (20 or 40 bytes), and with IPv6, an additional 8 bytes for\
      the Fragment Header.\
\
   o  Fragmentation and reassembly require computation: splitting\
      datagrams to fragments is a non-trivial procedure, and so is their\
      reassembly.  For example, software router forwarding\
      implementations may not be able to perform these operations at\
      line rate.\
\
   o  At the time of reassembly, all the information (i.e., all the\
      fragments) is normally not available; when the first fragment\
      arrives to be reassembled, a buffer of the maximum possible size\
      may have to be allocated because the total length of the\
      reassembled datagram is not known at that time.  Furthermore, as\
      fragments might get lost, or be reordered or delayed, the\
      reassembly engine has to wait with the partial packet for some\
      time (e.g., 60 seconds [9]).  When this would have to be done at\
      the line rate, with, for example 10 Gbit/s speed, the length of\
      the buffers that reassembly might require would be prohibitive.\
\

RFC 4459         Packet Size Issues in Network Tunnels        April 2006\
\
\
   When examining router-to-router tunneling, the third problem is\
   likely the worst; certainly, a hardware computation and\
   implementation requirement would also be significant, but not all\
   that difficult in the end -- and the link capacity wasted in the\
   backbones by additional overhead might not be a huge problem either.\
\
   However, IPv4 identification header length is only 16 bits (compared\
   to 32 bits in IPv6), and if a larger number of packets are being\
   tunneled between two IP addresses, the ID is very likely to wrap and\
   cause data misassociation.  This reassembly wrongly combining data\
   from two unrelated packets causes data integrity and potentially a\
   confidentiality violation.  This problem is further described in\
   [12].\
\
   IPv6, and IPv4 with the DF bit set in the encapsulating header,\
   allows the tunnel endpoints to optimize the tunnel MTU and minimize\
   network-based reassembly.  This also prevents fragmentation of the\
   encapsulated packets on the tunnel path.  If the IPv4 encapsulating\
   header does not have the DF bit set, the tunnel endpoints will have\
   to perform a significant amount of fragmentation and reassembly,\
   while the use of PMTUD is minimized.\
\
   As Appendix A describes, the MTU of the tunnel is also a factor on\
   which packets require fragmentation and reassembly; the worst case\
   occurs if the tunnel MTU is "infinite" or equal to the physical\
   interface MTUs.\
\
   So, if reassembly could be made to work sufficiently reliably, this\
   would be one acceptable fallback solution but only for IPv6.\
\
3.2.  Signalling the Lower MTU to the Sources\
\
   Another approach is to use techniques like Path MTU Discovery (or\
   potentially a future derivative [13]) to signal to the sources whose\
   packets will be encapsulated in the network to send smaller packets\
   so that they can be encapsulated; in particular, when done on\
   routers, this includes two separable functions:\
\
   a.  Forwarding behaviour: when forwarding packets, if the IPv4-only\
       DF bit is set, the router sends an ICMP Packet Too Big message to\
       the source if the MTU of the egress link is too small.\
\
   b.  Router's "host" behaviour: when the router receives an ICMP\
       Packet Too Big message related to a tunnel, it (1) adjusts the\
       tunnel MTU, and (2) originates an ICMP Packet Too Big message to\
       the source address of the encapsulated packet. (2) can be done\
       either immediately or by waiting for the next packet to trigger\
       an ICMP; the former minimizes the packet loss due to MTU changes.\

\
RFC 4459         Packet Size Issues in Network Tunnels        April 2006\
\
\
   Note that this only works if the MTU of the tunnel is of reasonable\
   size, and not, for example, 64 kilobytes: see Appendix A for more.\
\
   This approach would presuppose that PMTUD works.  While it is\
   currently working for IPv6, and critical for its operation, there is\
   ample evidence that in IPv4, PMTUD is far from reliable due to, for\
   example firewalls and other boxes being configured to inappropriately\
   drop all the ICMP packets [14], or software bugs rendering PMTUD\
   inoperational.\
\
   Furthermore, there are two scenarios where signalling from the\
   network would be highly undesirable.  The first is when the\
   encapsulation would be done in such a prominent place in the network\
   that a very large number of sources would need to be signalled with\
   this information (possibly even multiple times, depending on how long\
   they keep their PMTUD state).  The second is when the encapsulation\
   is done for passive monitoring purposes (network management, lawful\
   interception, etc.) -- when it's critical that the sources whose\
   traffic is being encapsulated are not aware of this happening.\
\
   When desiring to avoid fragmentation, IPv4 requires one of two\
   alternatives [1]: copy the DF bit from the inner packets to the\
   encapsulating header, or always set the DF bit of the outer header.\
   The latter is better, especially in controlled environments, because\
   it forces PMTUD to converge immediately.\
\
   A related technique, which works with TCP under specific scenarios\
   only, is so-called "MSS clamping".  With that technique or rather a\
   "hack", the TCP packets' Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is reduced by\
   tunnel endpoints so that the TCP connection automatically restricts\
   itself to the maximum available packet size.  Obviously, this does\
   not work for UDP or other protocols that have no MSS.  This approach\
   is most applicable and used with PPPoE, but could be applied\
   otherwise as well; the approach also assumes that all the traffic\
   goes through tunnel endpoints that do MSS clamping -- this is trivial\
   for the single-homed access links, but could be a challenge\
   otherwise.\
\
   A new approach to PMTUD is in the works [13], but it is uncertain\
   whether that would fix the problems -- at least not the passive\
   monitoring requirements.\
\
3.3.  Encapsulate Only When There is Free MTU\
\
   The third approach is an operational one, depending on the\
   environment where encapsulation and decapsulation are being\
   performed.  That is, if an ISP would deploy tunneling in its\
   backbone, which would consist only of links supporting high MTUs\
\
\
\

\
\
   (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet or SDH/SONET), but all its customers and\
   peers would have a lower MTU (e.g., 1500, or the backbone MTU minus\
   the encapsulation overhead), this would imply that no packets (with\
   the encapsulation overhead added) would have a larger MTU than the\
   "backbone MTU", and all the encapsulated packets would always fit\
   MTU-wise in the backbone links.\
\
   This approach is highly assumptive of the deployment scenario.  It\
   may be desirable to build a tunnel to/from another ISP, for example,\
   where this might no longer hold; or there might be links in the\
   network that cannot support the higher MTUs to satisfy the tunneling\
   requirements; or the tunnel might be set up directly between the\
   customer and the ISP, in which case fragmentation would occur, with\
   tunneled fragments terminating on the ISP and thus requiring\
   reassembly capability from the ISP's equipment.\
\
   To restate, this approach can only be considered when tunneling is\
   done inside a part of specific kind of ISP's own network, not, for\
   example, transiting an ISP.\
\
   Another, related approach might be having the sources use only a low\
   enough MTU that would fit in all the physical MTUs; for example, IPv6\
   specifies the minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  For example, if all the\
   sources whose traffic would be encapsulated would use this as the\
   maximum packet size, there would probably always be enough free MTU\
   for encapsulation in the network.  However, this is not the case\
   today, and it would be completely unrealistic to assume that this\
   kind of approach could be made to work in general.\
\
   It is worth remembering that while the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes\
   [10], there are scenarios where the tunnel implementation must\
   implement fragmentation and reassembly [3]: for example, when having\
   an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel on top of a physical interface with an MTU of\
   1280 bytes, or when having two layers of IPv6 tunneling.  This can\
   only be avoided by ensuring that links on top of which IPv6 is being\
   tunneled have a somewhat larger MTU (e.g., 40 bytes) than 1280 bytes.\
   This conclusion can be generalized: because IP can be tunneled on top\
   of IP, no single minimum or maximum MTU can be found such that\
   fragmentation or signalling to the sources would never be needed.\
\
   All in all, while in certain operational environments it might be\
   possible to avoid any problems by deployment choices, or limiting the\
   MTU that the sources use, this is probably not a sufficiently good\
   general solution for the equipment vendors.  Other solutions must\
   also be provided.\

\
\
3.4.  Fragmentation of the Inner Packet\
\
   A final possibility is fragmenting the inner packet, before\
   encapsulation, in such a manner that the encapsulated packet fits in\
   the tunnel's path MTU (discovered using PMTUD).  However, one should\
   note that only IPv4 supports this "in-flight" fragmentation;\
   furthermore, it isn't allowed for packets where the Don't Fragment\
   bit has been set.  Even if one could ignore IPv6 completely, so many\
   IPv4 host stacks send packets with the DF bit set that this would\
   seem unfeasible.\
\
   However, there are existing implementations that violate the standard\
   that:\
\
   o  discard too big packets with the DF bit not set instead of\
      fragmenting them (this is rare);\
\
   o  ignore the DF bit completely, for all or specified interfaces; or\
\
   o  clear the DF bit before encapsulation, in the egress of configured\
      interfaces.  This is typically done for all the traffic, not just\
      too big packets (allowing configuring this is common).\
\
   This is non-compliant behaviour, but there are certainly uses for it,\
   especially in certain tightly controlled passive monitoring\
   scenarios, and it has potential for more generic applicability as\
   well, to work around PMTUD issues.\
\
   Clearing the DF bit effectively disables the sender's PMTUD for the\
   path beyond the tunnel.  This may result in fragmentation later in\
   the network, but as the packets have already been fragmented prior to\
   encapsulation, this fragmentation later on does not make matters\
   significantly worse.\
\
   As this is an implemented and desired (by some) behaviour, the full\
   impacts e.g., for the functioning of PMTUD (for example) should be\
   analyzed, and the use of fragmentation-related IPv4 bits should be\
   re-evaluated.\
\
   In summary, this approach provides a relatively easy fix for IPv4\
   problems, with potential for causing problems for PMTUD; as this\
   would not work with IPv6, it could not be considered a generic\
   solution.\

\
4.  Conclusions\
\
   Fragmentation and reassembly by the tunnel endpoints are a clear and\
   simple solution to the problem, but the hardware reassembly when the\
   packets get lost may face significant implementation challenges that\
   may be insurmountable.  This approach does not seem feasible,\
   especially for IPv4 with high data rates due to problems with\
   wrapping the fragment identification field [12].  Constant wrapping\
   may occur when the data rate is in the order of MB/s for IPv4 and in\
   the order of dozens of GB/s for IPv6.  However, this reassembly\
   approach is probably not a problem for passive monitoring\
   applications.\
\
   PMTUD techniques, at least at the moment and especially for IPv4,\
   appear to be too unreliable or unscalable to be used in the\
   backbones.  It is an open question whether a future solution might\
   work better in this aspect.\
\
   It is clear that in some environments the operational approach to the\
   problem, ensuring that fragmentation is never necessary by keeping\
   higher MTUs in the networks where encapsulated packets traverse, is\
   sufficient.  But this is unlikely to be enough in general, and for\
   vendors that may not be able to make assumptions about the operators'\
   deployments.\
\
   Fragmentation of the inner packet is only possible with IPv4, and is\
   sufficient only if standards-incompliant behaviour, with potential\
   for bad side-effects (e.g., for PMTUD), is adopted.  It should not be\
   used if there are alternatives; fragmentation of the outer packet\
   seems a better option for passive monitoring.\
\
   However, if reassembly in the network must be avoided, there are\
   basically two possibilities:\
\
   1.  For IPv6, use ICMP signalling or operational methods.\
\
   2.  For IPv4, packets for which the DF bit is not set can be\
       fragmented before encapsulation (and the encapsulating header\
       would have the DF bit set); packets whose DF bit is set would\
       need to get the DF bit cleared (though this is non-compliant).\
       This also minimizes the need for (unreliable) Internet-wide\
       PMTUD.\
\
   An interesting thing to explicitly note is that when tunneling is\
   done in a high-speed backbone, typically one may be able to make\
   assumptions on the environment; however, when reassembly is not\
   performed in such a network, it might be done in software or with\
   lower requirements, and there exists either a reassembly\

\
\
   implementation using PMTUD or using a separate approach for passive\
   monitoring -- so this might not be a real problem.\
\
   In consequence, the critical questions at this point appear to be 1)\
   whether a higher MTU can be assumed in the high-speed networks that\
   deploy tunneling, and 2) whether "slower-speed" networks could cope\
   with a software-based reassembly, a less capable hardware-based\
   reassembly, or the other workarounds.  An important future task would\
   be analyzing the observed incompliant behaviour about the DF bit to\
   note whether it has any unanticipated drawbacks.\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document describes different issues with packet sizes and in-\
   the-network tunneling; this does not have security considerations on\
   its own.\
\
   However, different solutions might have characteristics that may make\
   them more susceptible to attacks -- for example, a router-based\
   fragment reassembly could easily lead to (reassembly) buffer memory\
   exhaustion if the attacker sends a sufficient number of fragments\
   without sending all of them, so that the reassembly would be stalled\
   until a timeout; these and other fragment attacks (e.g., [15]) have\
   already been used against, for example, firewalls and host stacks,\
   and need to be taken into consideration in the implementations.\
\
   It is worth considering the cryptographic expense (which is typically\
   more significant than the reassembly, if done in software) with\
   fragmentation of the inner or outer packet.  If an outer fragment\
   goes missing, no cryptographic operations have been yet performed; if\
   an inner fragment goes missing, cryptographic operations have already\
   been performed.  Therefore, which of these approaches is preferable\
   also depends on whether cryptography or reassembly is already\
   provided in hardware; for high-speed routers, at least, one should be\
   able to assume that if it is performing relatively heavy\
   cryptography, hardware support is already required.\
\
   The solutions using PMTUD (and consequently ICMP) will also need to\
   take into account the attacks using ICMP.  In particular, an attacker\
   could send ICMP Packet Too Big messages indicating a very low MTU to\
   reduce the throughput and/or as a fragmentation/reassembly\
   denial-of-service attack.  This attack has been described in the\
   context of TCP in [16].\

Appendix A.  MTU of the Tunnel\
\
   Different tunneling mechanisms may treat the tunnel links as having\
   different kinds of MTU values.  Some might use the same default MTU\
   as for other interfaces; some others might use the default MTU minus\
   the expected IP overhead (e.g., 20, 28, or 40 bytes); some others\
   might even treat the tunnel as having an "infinite MTU", e.g., 64\
   kilobytes.\
\
   As [2] describes, having an infinite MTU, i.e., always fragmenting\
   the outer packet (and never the inner packet) and never performing\
   PMTUD for the tunnel path, is a very bad idea, especially in\
   host-to-router scenarios.  (It could be argued that if the nodes are\
   sure that this is a host-to-host tunnel, a larger MTU might make\
   sense if fragmentation and reassembly are more efficient than just\
   sending properly sized packets -- but this seems like a stretch.)\

   number of issues may arise when utilizing MEDs in dynamic or complex\
   topologies.\

\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The BGP MED attribute provides a mechanism for BGP speakers to convey\
   to an adjacent AS the optimal entry point into the local AS.  While\
   BGP MEDs function correctly in many scenarios, a number of issues may\
   arise when utilizing MEDs in dynamic or complex topologies.\
\
   While reading this document, note that the goal is to discuss both\
   implementation and deployment considerations regarding BGP MEDs.  In\
   addition, the intention is to provide guidance that both implementors\
   and network operators should be familiar with.  In some instances,\
   implementation advice varies from deployment advice.\
\
2.  Specification of Requirements\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.1.  About the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Attribute\
\
   The BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute, formerly known as the\
   INTER_AS_METRIC, is currently defined in section 5.1.4 of [BGP4], as\
   follows:\
\
      The MULTI_EXIT_DISC is an optional non-transitive attribute that\
      is intended to be used on external (inter-AS) links to\
      discriminate among multiple exit or entry points to the same\
      neighboring AS.  The value of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute is a\
      four-octet unsigned number, called a metric.  All other factors\
      being equal, the exit point with the lower metric SHOULD be\
      preferred.  If received over External BGP (EBGP), the\
      MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute MAY be propagated over Internal BGP\
      (IBGP) to other BGP speakers within the same AS (see also\
      9.1.2.2).  The MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute received from a\
      neighboring AS MUST NOT be propagated to other neighboring ASes.\
\
      A BGP speaker MUST implement a mechanism (based on local\
      configuration) that allows the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute to be\
      removed from a route.  If a BGP speaker is configured to remove\
      the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute from a route, then this removal MUST\
      be done prior to determining the degree of preference of the route\
      and prior to performing route selection (Decision Process phases 1\
      and 2).\
\
      An implementation MAY also (based on local configuration) alter\
      the value of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute received over EBGP.  If\
      a BGP speaker is configured to alter the value of the\

RFC 4451                 BGP MED Considerations               March 2006\
\
\
      MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute received over EBGP, then altering the\
      value MUST be done prior to determining the degree of preference\
      of the route and prior to performing route selection (Decision\
      Process phases 1 and 2).  See Section 9.1.2.2 for necessary\
      restrictions on this.\
\
   Section 9.1.2.2 (c) of [BGP4] defines the following route selection\
   criteria regarding MEDs:\
\
      c) Remove from consideration routes with less-preferred\
         MULTI_EXIT_DISC attributes.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC is only comparable\
         between routes learned from the same neighboring AS (the\
         neighboring AS is determined from the AS_PATH attribute).\
         Routes that do not have the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute are\
         considered to have the lowest possible MULTI_EXIT_DISC value.\
\
         This is also described in the following procedure:\
\
       for m = all routes still under consideration\
           for n = all routes still under consideration\
               if (neighborAS(m) == neighborAS(n)) and (MED(n) < MED(m))\
                   remove route m from consideration\
\
         In the pseudo-code above, MED(n) is a function that returns the\
         value of route n's MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute.  If route n has\
         no MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, the function returns the lowest\
         possible MULTI_EXIT_DISC value (i.e., 0).\
\
         Similarly, neighborAS(n) is a function that returns the\
         neighbor AS from which the route was received.  If the route is\
         learned via IBGP, and the other IBGP speaker didn't originate\
         the route, it is the neighbor AS from which the other IBGP\
         speaker learned the route.  If the route is learned via IBGP,\
         and the other IBGP speaker either (a) originated the route, or\
         (b) created the route by aggregation and the AS_PATH attribute\
         of the aggregate route is either empty or begins with an\
         AS_SET, it is the local AS.\
\
         If a MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute is removed before re-advertising\
         a route into IBGP, then comparison based on the received EBGP\
         MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute MAY still be performed.  If an\
         implementation chooses to remove MULTI_EXIT_DISC, then the\
         optional comparison on MULTI_EXIT_DISC, if performed, MUST be\
         performed only among EBGP-learned routes.  The best EBGP-\
         learned route may then be compared with IBGP-learned routes\
         after the removal of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute.  If\
         MULTI_EXIT_DISC is removed from a subset of EBGP-learned\
         routes, and the selected "best" EBGP-learned route will not\

\
         have MULTI_EXIT_DISC removed, then the MULTI_EXIT_DISC must be\
         used in the comparison with IBGP-learned routes.  For IBGP-\
         learned routes, the MULTI_EXIT_DISC MUST be used in route\
         comparisons that reach this step in the Decision Process.\
         Including the MULTI_EXIT_DISC of an EBGP-learned route in the\
         comparison with an IBGP-learned route, then removing the\
         MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, and advertising the route has been\
         proven to cause route loops.\
\
2.2.  MEDs and Potatoes\
\
   Let's consider a situation where traffic flows between a pair of\
   hosts, each connected to a different transit network, which is in\
   itself interconnected at two or more locations.  Each transit network\
   has the choice of either sending traffic to the closest peering to\
   the adjacent transit network or passing traffic to the\
   interconnection location that advertises the least-cost path to the\
   destination host.\
\
   The former method is called "hot potato routing" (or closest-exit)\
   because like a hot potato held in bare hands, whoever has it tries to\
   get rid of it quickly.  Hot potato routing is accomplished by not\
   passing the EBGP-learned MED into IBGP.  This minimizes transit\
   traffic for the provider routing the traffic.  Far less common is\
   "cold potato routing" (or best-exit) where the transit provider uses\
   its own transit capacity to get the traffic to the point that\
   adjacent transit provider advertised as being closest to the\
   destination.  Cold potato routing is accomplished by passing the\
   EBGP-learned MED into IBGP.\
\
   If one transit provider uses hot potato routing and another uses cold\
   potato, traffic between the two tends to be more symmetric.  However,\
   if both providers employ cold potato routing or hot potato routing\
   between their networks, it's likely that a larger amount of asymmetry\
   would exist.\
\
   Depending on the business relationships, if one provider has more\
   capacity or a significantly less congested backbone network, then\
   that provider may use cold potato routing.  An example of widespread\
   use of cold potato routing was the NSF-funded NSFNET backbone and\
   NSF-funded regional networks in the mid-1990s.\
\
   In some cases, a provider may use hot potato routing for some\
   destinations for a given peer AS and cold potato routing for others.\
   An example of this is the different treatment of commercial and\
   research traffic in the NSFNET in the mid-1990s.  Today, many\

\
\
   commercial networks exchange MEDs with customers but not with\
   bilateral peers.  However, commercial use of MEDs varies widely, from\
   ubiquitous use to none at all.\
\
   In addition, many deployments of MEDs today are likely behaving\
   differently (e.g., resulting in sub-optimal routing) than the network\
   operator intended, which results not in hot or cold potatoes, but\
   mashed potatoes!  More information on unintended behavior resulting\
   from MEDs is provided throughout this document.\
\
3.  Implementation and Protocol Considerations\
\
   There are a number of implementation and protocol peculiarities\
   relating to MEDs that have been discovered that may affect network\
   behavior.  The following sections provide information on these\
   issues.\
\
3.1.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC Is an Optional Non-Transitive Attribute\
\
   MULTI_EXIT_DISC is a non-transitive optional attribute whose\
   advertisement to both IBGP and EBGP peers is discretionary.  As a\
   result, some implementations enable sending of MEDs to IBGP peers by\
   default, while others do not.  This behavior may result in sub-\
   optimal route selection within an AS.  In addition, some\
   implementations send MEDs to EBGP peers by default, while others do\
   not.  This behavior may result in sub-optimal inter-domain route\
   selection.\
\
3.2.  MED Values and Preferences\
\
   Some implementations consider an MED value of zero less preferable\
   than no MED value.  This behavior resulted in path selection\
   inconsistencies within an AS.  The current version of the BGP\
   specification [BGP4] removes ambiguities that existed in [RFC1771] by\
   stating that if route n has no MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute, the lowest\
   possible MULTI_EXIT_DISC value (i.e., 0) should be assigned to the\
   attribute.\
\
   It is apparent that different implementations and different versions\
   of the BGP specification have been all over the map with\
   interpretation of missing-MED.  For example, earlier versions of the\
   specification called for a missing MED to be assigned the highest\
   possible MED value (i.e., 2^32-1).\
\
   In addition, some implementations have been shown to internally\
   employ a maximum possible MED value (2^32-1) as an "infinity" metric\
   (i.e., the MED value is used to tag routes as unfeasible); upon\
   receiving an update with an MED value of 2^32-1, they would rewrite\
\

\
RFC 4451                 BGP MED Considerations               March 2006\
\
\
   the value to 2^32-2.  Subsequently, the new MED value would be\
   propagated and could result in routing inconsistencies or unintended\
   path selections.\
\
   As a result of implementation inconsistencies and protocol revision\
   variances, many network operators today explicitly reset (i.e., set\
   to zero or some other 'fixed' value) all MED values on ingress to\
   conform to their internal routing policies (i.e., to include policy\
   that requires that MED values of 0 and 2^32-1 not be used in\
   configurations, whether the MEDs are directly computed or\
   configured), so as not to have to rely on all their routers having\
   the same missing-MED behavior.\
\
   Because implementations don't normally provide a mechanism to disable\
   MED comparisons in the decision algorithm, "not using MEDs" usually\
   entails explicitly setting all MEDs to some fixed value upon ingress\
   to the routing domain.  By assigning a fixed MED value consistently\
   to all routes across the network, MEDs are a effectively a non-issue\
   in the decision algorithm.\
\
3.3.  Comparing MEDs between Different Autonomous Systems\
\
   The MED was intended to be used on external (inter-AS) links to\
   discriminate among multiple exit or entry points to the same\
   neighboring AS.  However, a large number of MED applications now\
   employ MEDs for the purpose of determining route preference between\
   like routes received from different autonomous systems.\
\
   A large number of implementations provide the capability to enable\
   comparison of MEDs between routes received from different neighboring\
   autonomous systems.  While this capability has demonstrated some\
   benefit (e.g., that described in [RFC3345]), operators should be wary\
   of the potential side effects of enabling such a function.  The\
   deployment section below provides some examples as to why this may\
   result in undesirable behavior.\
\
3.4.  MEDs, Route Reflection, and AS Confederations for BGP\
\
   In particular configurations, the BGP scaling mechanisms defined in\
   "BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP" [RFC2796]\
   and "Autonomous System Confederations for BGP" [RFC3065] will\
   introduce persistent BGP route oscillation [RFC3345].  The problem is\
   inherent in the way BGP works: a conflict exists between information\
   hiding/hierarchy and the non-hierarchical selection process imposed\
   by lack of total ordering caused by the MED rules.  Given current\
   practices, we see the problem manifest itself most frequently in the\
   context of MED + route reflectors or confederations.\

RFC 4451                 BGP MED Considerations               March 2006\
\
\
   One potential way to avoid this is by configuring inter-Member-AS or\
   inter-cluster IGP metrics higher than intra-Member-AS IGP metrics\
   and/or using other tie-breaking policies to avoid BGP route selection\
   based on incomparable MEDs.  Of course, IGP metric constraints may be\
   unreasonably onerous for some applications.\
\
   Not comparing MEDs between multiple paths for a prefix learned from\
   different adjacent autonomous systems, as discussed in section 2.3,\
   or not utilizing MEDs at all, significantly decreases the probability\
   of introducing potential route oscillation conditions into the\
   network.\
\
   Although perhaps "legal" as far as current specifications are\
   concerned, modifying MED attributes received on any type of IBGP\
   session (e.g., standard IBGP, EBGP sessions between Member-ASes of a\
   BGP confederation, route reflection, etc.) is not recommended.\
\
3.5.  Route Flap Damping and MED Churn\
\
   MEDs are often derived dynamically from IGP metrics or additive costs\
   associated with an IGP metric to a given BGP NEXT_HOP.  This\
   typically provides an efficient model for ensuring that the BGP MED\
   advertised to peers, used to represent the best path to a given\
   destination within the network, is aligned with that of the IGP\
   within a given AS.\
\
   The consequence with dynamically derived IGP-based MEDs is that\
   instability within an AS, or even on a single given link within the\
   AS, can result in widespread BGP instability or BGP route\
   advertisement churn that propagates across multiple domains.  In\
   short, if your MED "flaps" every time your IGP metric flaps, your\
   routes are likely going to be suppressed as a result of BGP Route\
   Flap Damping [RFC2439].\
\
   Employment of MEDs may compound the adverse effects of BGP flap-\
   dampening behavior because it may cause routes to be re-advertised\
   solely to reflect an internal topology change.\
\
   Many implementations don't have a practical problem with IGP\
   flapping; they either latch their IGP metric upon first advertisement\
   or employ some internal suppression mechanism.  Some implementations\
   regard BGP attribute changes as less significant than route\
   withdrawals and announcements to attempt to mitigate the impact of\
   this type of event.\

\
\
3.6.  Effects of MEDs on Update Packing Efficiency\
\
   Multiple unfeasible routes can be advertised in a single BGP Update\
   message.  The BGP4 protocol also permits advertisement of multiple\
   prefixes with a common set of path attributes to be advertised in a\
   single update message.  This is commonly referred to as "update\
   packing".  When possible, update packing is recommended as it\
   provides a mechanism for more efficient behavior in a number of\
   areas, including the following:\
\
      o Reduction in system overhead due to generation or receipt of\
        fewer Update messages.\
\
      o Reduction in network overhead as a result of fewer packets and\
        lower bandwidth consumption.\
\
      o Less frequent processing of path attributes and searches for\
        matching sets in your AS_PATH database (if you have one).\
        Consistent ordering of the path attributes allows for ease of\
        matching in the database as you don't have different\
        representations of the same data.\
\
   Update packing requires that all feasible routes within a single\
   update message share a common attribute set, to include a common\
   MULTI_EXIT_DISC value.  As such, potential wide-scale variance in MED\
   values introduces another variable and may result in a marked\
   decrease in update packing efficiency.\
\
3.7.  Temporal Route Selection\
\
   Some implementations had bugs that led to temporal behavior in\
   MED-based best path selection.  These usually involved methods to\
   store the oldest route and to order routes for MED, which caused\
   non-deterministic behavior as to whether or not the oldest route\
   would truly be selected.\
\
   The reasoning for this is that older paths are presumably more\
   stable, and thus preferable.  However, temporal behavior in route\
   selection results in non-deterministic behavior and, as such, is\
   often undesirable.\

RFC 4451                 BGP MED Considerations               March 2006\
\
\
4.  Deployment Considerations\
\
   It has been discussed that accepting MEDs from other autonomous\
   systems has the potential to cause traffic flow churns in the\
   network.  Some implementations only ratchet down the MED and never\
   move it back up to prevent excessive churn.\
\
   However, if a session is reset, the MEDs being advertised have the\
   potential of changing.  If a network is relying on received MEDs to\
   route traffic properly, the traffic patterns have the potential for\
   changing dramatically, potentially resulting in congestion on the\
   network.  Essentially, accepting and routing traffic based on MEDs\
   allows other people to traffic engineer your network.  This may or\
   may not be acceptable to you.\
\
   As previously discussed, many network operators choose to reset MED\
   values on ingress.  In addition, many operators explicitly do not\
   employ MED values of 0 or 2^32-1 in order to avoid inconsistencies\
   with implementations and various revisions of the BGP specification.\
\
4.1.  Comparing MEDs between Different Autonomous Systems\
\
   Although the MED was meant to be used only when comparing paths\
   received from different external peers in the same AS, many\
   implementations provide the capability to compare MEDs between\
   different autonomous systems as well.  AS operators often use\
   LOCAL_PREF to select the external preferences (primary, secondary\
   upstreams, peers, customers, etc.), using MED instead of LOCAL_PREF\
   would possibly lead to an inconsistent distribution of best routes,\
   as MED is compared only after the AS_PATH length.\
\
   Though this may seem like a fine idea for some configurations, care\
   must be taken when comparing MEDs between different autonomous\
   systems.  BGP speakers often derive MED values by obtaining the IGP\
   metric associated with reaching a given BGP NEXT_HOP within the local\
   AS.  This allows MEDs to reasonably reflect IGP topologies when\
   advertising routes to peers.  While this is fine when comparing MEDs\
   between multiple paths learned from a single AS, it can result in\
   potentially "weighted" decisions when comparing MEDs between\
   different autonomous systems.  This is most typically the case when\
   the autonomous systems use different mechanisms to derive IGP metrics\
   or BGP MEDs, or when they perhaps even use different IGP protocols\
   with vastly contrasting metric spaces (e.g., OSPF vs. traditional\
   metric space in IS-IS).\

RFC 4451                 BGP MED Considerations               March 2006\
\
\
4.2.  Effects of Aggregation on MEDs\
\
   Another MED deployment consideration involves the impact that\
   aggregation of BGP routing information has on MEDs.  Aggregates are\
   often generated from multiple locations in an AS in order to\
   accommodate stability, redundancy, and other network design goals.\
   When MEDs are derived from IGP metrics associated with said\
   aggregates, the MED value advertised to peers can result in very\
   suboptimal routing.\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   The MED was purposely designed to be a "weak" metric that would only\
   be used late in the best-path decision process.  The BGP working\
   group was concerned that any metric specified by a remote operator\
   would only affect routing in a local AS if no other preference was\
   specified.  A paramount goal of the design of the MED was to ensure\
   that peers could not "shed" or "absorb" traffic for networks that\
   they advertise.  As such, accepting MEDs from peers may in some sense\
   increase a network's susceptibility to exploitation by peers.\

Abstract\
\
   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\
   routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets.  Typically, all BGP\
   speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external\
   routing information must be re-distributed to all other routers\
   within that Autonomous System (AS).  This represents a serious\
   scaling problem that has been well documented with several\
   alternatives proposed.\
\
   This document describes the use and design of a method known as\
   "route reflection" to alleviate the need for "full mesh" Internal BGP\
   (IBGP).\
\
   This document obsoletes RFC 2796 and RFC 1966.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Typically, all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed\
   and any external routing information must be re-distributed to all\
   other routers within that AS.  For n BGP speakers within an AS that\
   requires to maintain n*(n-1)/2 unique Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions.\
   This "full mesh" requirement clearly does not scale when there are a\
   large number of IBGP speakers each exchanging a large volume of\
   routing information, as is common in many of today's networks.\
\
   This scaling problem has been well documented, and a number of\
   proposals have been made to alleviate this [2,3].  This document\
   represents another alternative in alleviating the need for a "full\
   mesh" and is known as "route reflection".  This approach allows a BGP\
   speaker (known as a "route reflector") to advertise IBGP learned\

   understood concept of IBGP, and the addition of two new optional\
   non-transitive BGP attributes to prevent loops in routing updates.\

\
\
3.  Design Criteria\
\
   Route reflection was designed to satisfy the following criteria.\
\
      o  Simplicity\
\
         Any alternative must be simple to configure and easy to\
         understand.\
\
      o  Easy Transition\
\
         It must be possible to transition from a full-mesh\
         configuration without the need to change either topology or AS.\
         This is an unfortunate management overhead of the technique\
         proposed in [3].\
\
      o  Compatibility\
\
         It must be possible for noncompliant IBGP peers to continue to\
         be part of the original AS or domain without any loss of BGP\
         routing information.\
\
   These criteria were motivated by operational experiences of a very\
   large and topology-rich network with many external connections.\
\
4.  Route Reflection\
\
   The basic idea of route reflection is very simple.  Let us consider\
   the simple example depicted in Figure 1 below.\

\
   route and it is selected as the best path it must advertise the\
   external route to both RTR-B and RTR-C.  RTR-B and RTR-C (as IBGP\
   speakers) will not re-advertise these IBGP learned routes to other\
   IBGP speakers.\
\
   If this rule is relaxed and RTR-C is allowed to advertise IBGP\
   learned routes to IBGP peers, then it could re-advertise (or reflect)\
   the IBGP routes learned from RTR-A to RTR-B and vice versa.  This\
   would eliminate the need for the IBGP session between RTR-A and RTR-B\
   as shown in Figure 2 below.\

   The route reflection scheme is based upon this basic principle.\
\
5.  Terminology and Concepts\
\
   We use the term "route reflection" to describe the operation of a BGP\
   speaker advertising an IBGP learned route to another IBGP peer.  Such\
   a BGP speaker is said to be a "route reflector" (RR), and such a\
   route is said to be a reflected route.\
\
   The internal peers of an RR are divided into two groups:\
\
      1) Client peers\
\
      2) Non-Client peers\
\
   An RR reflects routes between these groups, and may reflect routes\
   among client peers.  An RR along with its client peers form a\
   cluster.  The Non-Client peer must be fully meshed but the Client\
   peers need not be fully meshed.  Figure 3 depicts a simple example\
   outlining the basic RR components using the terminology noted above.\

\
6.  Operation\
\
   When an RR receives a route from an IBGP peer, it selects the best\
   path based on its path selection rule.  After the best path is\
   selected, it must do the following depending on the type of peer it\
   is receiving the best path from\
\
      1) A route from a Non-Client IBGP peer:\
\
         Reflect to all the Clients.\
\
      2) A route from a Client peer:\
\
         Reflect to all the Non-Client peers and also to the Client\
         peers.  (Hence the Client peers are not required to be fully\
         meshed.)\
\
   An Autonomous System could have many RRs.  An RR treats other RRs\
   just like any other internal BGP speakers.  An RR could be configured\
   to have other RRs in a Client group or Non-client group.\
\
\
\
\
\
Bates, et al.               Standards Track                     [Page 5]\

RFC 4456                  BGP Route Reflection                April 2006\
\
\
   In a simple configuration, the backbone could be divided into many\
   clusters.  Each RR would be configured with other RRs as Non-Client\
   peers (thus all the RRs will be fully meshed).  The Clients will be\
   configured to maintain IBGP session only with the RR in their\
   cluster.  Due to route reflection, all the IBGP speakers will receive\
   reflected routing information.\
\
   It is possible in an Autonomous System to have BGP speakers that do\
   not understand the concept of route reflectors (let us call them\
   conventional BGP speakers).  The route reflector scheme allows such\
   conventional BGP speakers to coexist.  Conventional BGP speakers\
   could be members of either a Non-Client group or a Client group.\
   This allows for an easy and gradual migration from the current IBGP\
   model to the route reflection model.  One could start creating\
   clusters by configuring a single router as the designated RR and\
   configuring other RRs and their clients as normal IBGP peers.\
   Additional clusters can be created gradually.\
\
7.  Redundant RRs\
\
   Usually, a cluster of clients will have a single RR.  In that case,\
   the cluster will be identified by the BGP Identifier of the RR.\
   However, this represents a single point of failure so to make it\
   possible to have multiple RRs in the same cluster, all RRs in the\
   same cluster can be configured with a 4-byte CLUSTER_ID so that an RR\
   can discard routes from other RRs in the same cluster.\
\
8.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops\
\
   When a route is reflected, it is possible through misconfiguration to\
   form route re-distribution loops.  The route reflection method\
   defines the following attributes to detect and avoid routing\
   information loops:\
\
   ORIGINATOR_ID\
\
   ORIGINATOR_ID is a new optional, non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\
   code 9.  This attribute is 4 bytes long and it will be created by an\
   RR in reflecting a route.  This attribute will carry the BGP\
   Identifier of the originator of the route in the local AS.  A BGP\
   speaker SHOULD NOT create an ORIGINATOR_ID attribute if one already\
   exists.  A router that recognizes the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute SHOULD\
   ignore a route received with its BGP Identifier as the ORIGINATOR_ID.\
\

RFC 4456                  BGP Route Reflection                April 2006\
\
\
   CLUSTER_LIST\
\
   CLUSTER_LIST is a new, optional, non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\
   code 10.  It is a sequence of CLUSTER_ID values representing the\
   reflection path that the route has passed.\
\
   When an RR reflects a route, it MUST prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to\
   the CLUSTER_LIST.  If the CLUSTER_LIST is empty, it MUST create a new\
   one.  Using this attribute an RR can identify if the routing\
   information has looped back to the same cluster due to\
   misconfiguration.  If the local CLUSTER_ID is found in the\
   CLUSTER_LIST, the advertisement received SHOULD be ignored.\
\
9.  Impact on Route Selection\
\
   The BGP Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Sect.  9.1.2.2, [1]) are\
   modified as follows:\
\
      If a route carries the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, then in Step f)\
      the ORIGINATOR_ID SHOULD be treated as the BGP Identifier of the\
      BGP speaker that has advertised the route.\
\
      In addition, the following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps\
      f) and g): a BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter\
      CLUSTER_LIST length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route\
      does not carry the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.\
\
10.  Implementation Considerations\
\
   Care should be taken to make sure that none of the BGP path\
   attributes defined above can be modified through configuration when\
   exchanging internal routing information between RRs and Clients and\
   Non-Clients.  Their modification could potentially result in routing\
   loops.\
\
   In addition, when a RR reflects a route, it SHOULD NOT modify the\
   following path attributes: NEXT_HOP, AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, and MED.\
   Their modification could potentially result in routing loops.\
\
11.  Configuration and Deployment Considerations\
\
   The BGP protocol provides no way for a Client to identify itself\
   dynamically as a Client of an RR.  The simplest way to achieve this\
   is by manual configuration.\
\
   One of the key component of the route reflection approach in\
   addressing the scaling issue is that the RR summarizes routing\
   information and only reflects its best path.\
\

RFC 4456                  BGP Route Reflection                April 2006\
\
\
   Both Multi-Exit Discriminators (MEDs) and Interior Gateway Protocol\
   (IGP) metrics may impact the BGP route selection.  Because MEDs are\
   not always comparable and the IGP metric may differ for each router,\
   with certain route reflection topologies the route reflection\
   approach may not yield the same route selection result as that of the\
   full IBGP mesh approach.  A way to make route selection the same as\
   it would be with the full IBGP mesh approach is to make sure that\
   route reflectors are never forced to perform the BGP route selection\
   based on IGP metrics that are significantly different from the IGP\
   metrics of their clients, or based on incomparable MEDs.  The former\
   can be achieved by configuring the intra-cluster IGP metrics to be\
   better than the inter-cluster IGP metrics, and maintaining full mesh\
   within the cluster.  The latter can be achieved by\
\
      o  setting the local preference of a route at the border router to\
         reflect the MED values, or\
\
      o  making sure the AS-path lengths from different ASes are\
         different when the AS-path length is used as a route selection\
         criteria, or\
\
      o  configuring community-based policies to influence the route\
         selection.\
\
   One could argue though that the latter requirement is overly\
   restrictive, and perhaps impractical in some cases.  One could\
   further argue that as long as there are no routing loops, there are\
   no compelling reasons to force route selection with route reflectors\
   to be the same as it would be with the full IBGP mesh approach.\
\
   To prevent routing loops and maintain consistent routing view, it is\
   essential that the network topology be carefully considered in\
   designing a route reflection topology.  In general, the route\
   reflection topology should be congruent with the network topology\
   when there exist multiple paths for a prefix.  One commonly used\
   approach is the reflection based on Point of Presence (POP), in which\
   each POP maintains its own route reflectors serving clients in the\
   POP, and all route reflectors are fully meshed.  In addition, clients\
   of the reflectors in each POP are often fully meshed for the purpose\
   of optimal intra-POP routing, and the intra-POP IGP metrics are\
   configured to be better than the inter-POP IGP metrics.\
\
12.  Security Considerations\
\
   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues\
   inherent in the existing IBGP [1, 5].\

Appendix A: Comparison with RFC 2796\
\
   The impact on route selection is added.\
\
   The pictorial description of the encoding of the CLUSTER_LIST\
   attribute is removed as the description is redundant to the BGP\
   specification, and the attribute length field is inadvertently\
   described as one octet.\
\
Appendix B: Comparison with RFC 1966\
\
   All the changes listed in Appendix A, plus the following.\
\
   Several terminologies related to route reflection are clarified, and\
   the reference to EBGP routes/peers are removed.\
\
   The handling of a routing information loop (due to route reflection)\
   by a receiver is clarified and made more consistent.\
\
   The addition of a CLUSTER_ID to the CLUSTER_LIST has been changed\
   from "append" to "prepend" to reflect the deployed code.\
\
   The section on "Configuration and Deployment Considerations" has been\
   expanded to address several operational issues.\

Abstract\
\
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across\
   many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant\
   messaging, and presence.  In its current form, it allows session\
   invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered\
   from one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the\
   recipient.  Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used\
   for malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service attacks.\
   This document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP\
   that add consent-based communications.\

RFC 4453                  Consent Requirements                April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] supports communications\
   across many media types, including real-time audio, video, text,\
   instant messaging, and presence.  This communication is established\
   by the transmission of various SIP requests (such as INVITE and\
   MESSAGE [3]) from an initiator to the recipient, with whom\
   communication is desired.  Although a recipient of such a SIP request\
   can reject the request, and therefore decline the session, a SIP\
   network will deliver a SIP request to the recipient without their\
   explicit consent.\
\
   Receipt of these requests without explicit consent can cause a number\
   of problems in SIP networks.  These include amplification attacks.\
   These problems have plagued email.  At the time of this writing, most\
   SIP services are not interconnected, so the incidence of\
   amplification attacks directed at SIP services is low compared to the\
   same attacks on email services.  The SIPPING working group believes\
   it is necessary to address these attacks proactively so the attacks\
   do not become as burdensome as attacks on email have become.\
\
   This document elaborates on the problems posed by the current open\
   model in which SIP was designed, and then goes on to define a set of\
   requirements for adding a consent framework to SIP.\
\
2.  Problem Statement\
\
   In SIP networks designed according to the principles of RFC 3261 [1]\
   and RFC 3263 [2], anyone on the Internet can create and send a SIP\
   request to any other SIP user, by identifying that user with a SIP\
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  The SIP network will usually\
   deliver this request to the user identified by that URI.  It is\
   possible, of course, for network services, such as call screening, to\
   block such messaging from occurring, but this is not widespread and\
   certainly not a systematic solution to the problem under\
   consideration here.\
\
   Once the SIP request is received by the recipient, the user agent\
   typically takes some kind of automated action to alert the user about\
   receipt of the message.  For INVITE requests, this usually involves\
   delivering an audible alert (e.g., "ringing the phone"), or a visual\
   alert (e.g., creating a screen pop-up window).  These indicators\
   frequently convey the subject of the call and the identity of the\
   caller.  Due to the real-time nature of the session, these alerts are\
   typically disruptive in nature, so as to get the attention of the\
   user.\

RFC 4453                  Consent Requirements                April 2006\
\
\
   For MESSAGE requests, the content of the message is usually rendered\
   to the user.\
\
   SUBSCRIBE [4] requests do not normally get delivered to the user\
   agents residing on a user's devices.  Rather, they are normally\
   processed by network-based state agents.  The watcher information\
   event package allows a user to find out that such requests were\
   generated for them, affording the user the opportunity to approve or\
   deny the request.  As a result, SUBSCRIBE processing, and most\
   notably presence, already has a consent-based operation.\
   Nevertheless, this already-existing consent mechanism for SIP\
   subscriptions does not protect network agents against denial-of-\
   service (DoS) attacks.\
\
   A problem that arises when requests can be delivered to user agents\
   directly, without their consent, is amplification attacks.  SIP\
   proxies provide a convenient relay point for targeting a message to a\
   particular user or IP address and, in particular, forwarding to a\
   recipient that is often not directly reachable without usage of the\
   proxy.  Some SIP proxy servers forward a single request to several\
   instances or contacts for the same user or resource.  This process is\
   called "forking".  Another type of SIP server provides the SIP URI-\
   list service [5], which sends a new copy of the same request to each\
   recipient in the URI-list.  Examples of URI-list services are\
   subscriptions to resource lists [6], dial-out conference servers [8],\
   and MESSAGE URI-list services [7].  A SIP URI-list service could be\
   used as an amplifier, allowing a single SIP request to flood a single\
   target host or network.  For example, a user can create a resource\
   list with 100 entries, each of which is a URI of the form\
   "sip:identifier@target-IP", where target-IP is the IP address to\
   which the attack is to be directed.  Sending a single SIP SUBSCRIBE\
   request to such a list will cause the resource list server to\
   generate 100 SUBSCRIBE requests, each to the IP address of the\
   target, which does not even need to be a SIP node.\
\
      Note that the target-IP does not need to be the same in all the\
      URIs in order to attack a single machine.  For example, the\
      target-IP addresses may all belong to the same subnetwork, in\
      which case the target of the attack would be the access router of\
      the subnetwork.\
\
   In addition to launching DoS attacks, attackers could also use SIP\
   URI-list servers as amplifiers to deliver spam.  For INVITE requests,\
   this takes the form of typical "telemarketer" calls.  A user might\
   receive a stream of never-ending requests for communications, each of\
   them disrupting the user and demanding their attention.  For MESSAGE\

\
\
   requests, the problem is even more severe.  The user might receive a\
   never-ending stream of visual alerts (e.g., screen pop-up windows)\
   that deliver unwanted, malicious, or otherwise undesired content.\
\
   Both amplification attacks related to spam and DoS can be alleviated\
   by adding a consent-based communications framework to SIP.  Such a\
   framework keeps servers from relaying messages to users without their\
   consent.\
\
      The framework for SIP URI-list services [5] identifies\
      amplification attacks as a problem in the context of URI-list\
      services.  That framework mandates the use of opt-in lists, which\
      are a form of consent-based communications.  The reader can find\
      an analysis on how a consent-based framework helps alleviate\
      spam-related problems in [9].\
\
3.  Requirements\
\
   The following identify requirements for a solution that provides\
   consent-based communications in SIP.  A relay is defined as any SIP\
   server, be it a proxy, Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), or some\
   hybrid, that receives a request and translates the request URI into\
   one or more next-hop URIs to which it then delivers a request.\
\
   REQ 1:  The solution must keep relays from delivering a SIP request\
      to a recipient unless the recipient has explicitly granted\
      permission to the relay using appropriately authenticated\
      messages.\
\
   REQ 2:  The solution shall prevent relays from generating more than\
      one outbound request in response to an inbound request, unless\
      permission to do so has been granted by the resource to whom the\
      outbound request was to be targeted.  This requirement avoids the\
      consent mechanism itself becoming the focus of DoS attacks.\
\
   REQ 3:  The permissions shall be capable of specifying that messages\
      from a specific user, identified by a SIP URI that is an Address-\
      of-Record (AOR), are permitted.\
\
   REQ 4:  Each recipient AOR must be able to specify permissions\
      separately for each SIP service that forwards messages to the\
      recipient.  For example, Alice may authorize forwarding to her\
      from domain A, but not from domain B.\
\
   REQ 5:  It shall be possible for a user to revoke permissions at any\
      time.\

RFC 4453                  Consent Requirements                April 2006\
\
\
   REQ 6:  It shall not be required for a user or user agent to store\
      information in order to be able to revoke permissions that were\
      previously granted for a relay resource.\
\
   REQ 7:  The solution shall work in an inter-domain context, without\
      requiring preestablished relationships between domains.\
\
   REQ 8:  The solution shall work for all current and future SIP\
      methods.\
\
   REQ 9:  The solution shall be applicable to forking proxies.\
\
   REQ 10:  The solution shall be applicable to URI-list services, such\
      as resource list servers [5], MESSAGE URI-list services [7], and\
      conference servers performing dial-out functions [8].\
\
   REQ 11:  In SIP, URI-lists can be stored on the URI-list server or\
      provided in a SIP request.  The consent framework must work in\
      both cases.\
\
   REQ 12:  The solution shall allow anonymous communications, as long\
      as the recipient is willing to accept anonymous communications.\
\
   REQ 13:  If the recipient of a request wishes to be anonymous with\
      respect to the original sender, it must be possible for the\
      recipient to grant permission for the sender without the original\
      sender learning the recipient's identity.\
\
   REQ 14:  The solution shall prevent attacks that seek to undermine\
      the underlying goal of consent.  That is, it should not be\
      possible to "fool" the system into delivering a request for which\
      permission was not, in fact, granted.\
\
   REQ 15:  The solution shall not require the recipient of the\
      communications to be connected to the network at the time\
      communications are attempted.\
\
   REQ 16:  The solution shall not require the sender of a SIP request\
      to be connected at the time that a recipient provides permission.\
\
   REQ 17:  The solution should scale to Internet-wide deployment.\

RFC 4457              The P-User-Database P-Header            April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia\
   Subsystem) uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] as its main\
   signalling protocol.  (For more information on the IMS, a detailed\
   description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.229\
   [6].) 3GPP has identified a set of requirements that can be met,\
   according to the procedures in RFC 3427 [3], by defining a new SIP\
   Private-Header (P-header).\
\
   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2\
   describes the scenarios considered by 3GPP and Section 3 discusses\
   the requirements derived from these scenarios.  Section 4 defines the\
   P-User-Database header field, which meets those requirements, and\
   Section 5 discusses the applicability and scope of this new header\
   field.  Section 6 registers the P-User-Database header field with the\
   IANA and Section 7 discusses the security properties of the\
   environment where this header field is intended to be used.\
\
2.  Scenarios\
\
   In the 3GPP IMS, there are two scenarios where a set of proxies\
   handling a request need to consult the same user database.  These\
   scenarios consist of a user registering to the IMS network and an\
   unregistered user receiving an incoming request that triggers a\
   service (e.g., a voice mail service).\
\
2.1.  User Registering to the IMS\
\
   In the 3GPP IMS, SIP REGISTER requests generated by a User Agent (UA)\
   traverse a set of SIP proxy servers before reaching the SIP\
   registrar.  A REGISTER request sent by a UA is routed to the outbound\
   proxy of the UA, which is referred to as the P-CSCF (Proxy-\
   Call/Session Control Function).\
\
   The P-CSCF routes the REGISTER request to another proxy, which is\
   referred to as the I-CSCF (Interrogating-CSCF) and is always located\
   in the home domain of the user.  The I-CSCF consults the user\
   database of the domain, which is referred to as the Home Subscriber\
   Server (HSS), in order to choose the registrar that will process the\
   REGISTER request.\
\
   With the information received from the HSS, the I-CSCF routes the\
   REGISTER request to the appropriate registrar, which is referred to\
   as the S-CSCF (Serving-CSCF).  At this point, the S-CSCF needs to\
   contact the same HSS that was previously contacted by the I-CSCF in\
   order to fetch the user profile of the user that generated the\
   REGISTER request.\

   and the HSS is called Cx interface and is based on Diameter [4].\

   users in the domain, both the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF can be configured\
   with its address so that they contact it when necessary.  However,\
   some domains have several HSSs, each of which handles a particular\
   set of users.  When dealing with a REGISTER request, the I-CSCF and\
   the S-CSCF need to discover which is the HSS that contains the\
   profile of the user that generated the REGISTER request.\
\
   In networks with more than one HSS, a Diameter redirect agent\
   referred to as the Subscription Locator Function (SLF) is\
   implemented.  The interface between the I-CSCF and the SLF and\
   between the S-CSCF and the SLF is called Dx interface and, like the\
   CX interface, is based on Diameter.  The SLF provides the I-CSCF and\
   the S-CSCF with the address of the HSS that handles the user they are\
   dealing with.\
\
   Therefore, in a network with more than one HSS, the SLF is consulted\
   twice per REGISTER request, first by the I-CSCF, and later by the\
   S-CSCF.  If the I-CSCF could provide the S-CSCF with the address of\
   the HSS handling the user that generated the REGISTER request, the\
   S-CSCF could contact directly that HSS.  That is, the S-CSCF would\
   not need to contact the SLF in order to obtain the address of the\
   HSS.\
\
2.2.  Incoming Request for an Unregistered User\
\
   In the 3GPP IMS, incoming requests for a user traverse an I-CSCF in\
   the home domain of the user.  This I-CSCF consults the HSS, using the\
   Diameter-based Cx interface, in order to decide which S-CSCF should\
   handle the request.  After consulting the HSS, the I-CSCF forwards\
   the request to a S-CSCF, which is also located in the home domain of\
   the user.\
\
   If the user the request is addressed to is registered to the IMS\
   network, the S-CSCF receiving the request knows which HSS handles the\
   user.  The S-CSCF stored this information when the user registered.\
   However, if the user is not registered, the S-CSCF needs to consult\
   the SLF (assuming more than one HSS in the network) in order to\
   discover the HSS handling the user.\

RFC 4457              The P-User-Database P-Header            April 2006\
\
\
   Therefore, like in the previous scenario, in a network with more than\
   one HSS, the SLF is consulted twice per incoming request addresses to\
   an unregistered user.  First by the I-CSCF, and later by the S-CSCF.\
   If the I-CSCF could provide the S-CSCF with the address of the HSS\
   handling the user that generated the request, the S-CSCF could\
   contact directly that HSS.  That is, the S-CSCF would not need to\
   contact the SLF in order to obtain the address of the HSS.\
\
3.  Requirements\
\
   This section lists the requirements derived from the previous\
   scenarios:\
\
   1.  It is necessary to optimize the registration process in the 3GPP\
       IMS by reducing the time it takes for a UA to register to the IMS\
       network.\
\
   2.  It is necessary to optimize the handling of incoming requests to\
       unregistered users in the 3GPP IMS by reducing the time it takes\
       for a domain to handle these requests.\
\
   3.  It is necessary to improve the scalability of SLFs in the 3GPP\
       IMS by reducing the amount of traffic the SLF of a network needs\
       to handle.\
\
4.  P-User-Database Header Field Definition\
\
   This document defines the SIP P-User-Database P-header.  This header\
   field can be added to requests routed from an I-CSCF to an S-CSCF.\
   The P-User-Database P-header contains the address of the HSS handling\
   the user that generated the request.\
\
   The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [1] syntax of the P-User-\
   Database header field is the following:\
\
   P-User-Database     = "P-User-Database" HCOLON database\
                         *( SEMI generic-param )\
   database            = LAQUOT DiameterURI RAQUOT\
\
   DiameterURI is defined in RFC 3588 [4].  HCOLON, LAQUOT, RAQUOT, and\
   generic-param are defined in RFC 3261 [2].\
\
   The following is an example of a P-User-Database header field:\
\
   P-User-Database: <aaa://host.example.com;transport=tcp>\

RFC 4457              The P-User-Database P-Header            April 2006\
\
\
5.  Applicability\
\
   According to RFC 3427 [3], P-headers have a limited applicability.\
   Specifications of P-headers such as this RFC need to clearly document\
   the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its limitations and why\
   it is not suitable for the general use of SIP on the Internet.\
\
   The P-User-Database header field is intended to be used in 3GPP IMS\
   networks.  This header field carries the address of a user database,\
   which is referred to as HSS, between two proxies, which are referred\
   to as I-CSCF and S-CSCF.  The I-CSCF and the S-CSCF belong to the\
   same administrative domain and share a common frame of reference to\
   the user database.  The I-CSCF inserts the P-User-Database header\
   field into a SIP request and the S-CSCF removes it before routing the\
   request further.\
\
   When SIP is used on the Internet, there are typically no proxies\
   querying a user database between the UA sending a REGISTER request\
   and the registrar.  Consequently, the P-User-Database header field\
   does not seem useful in a general Internet environment.\
\
6.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document defines a new SIP header field: P-User-Database.  This\
   header field has been registered by the IANA in the SIP Parameters\
   registry under the Header Fields subregistry.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The P-User-Database defined in this document is to be used in an\
   environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are not\
   supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those\
   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes\
   achieved by using IP Security (IPsec) and sometimes by physically\
   protecting the network.  In any case, the environment where the\
   P-User-Database header field will be used ensures the integrity and\
   the confidentiality of the contents of this header field.\
\
   There is a slight security risk if a P-User-Database header field is\
   allowed to propagate out of the administrative domain where it was\
   generated.  No user-sensitive information would be revealed by such a\
   breach, but this could result in disclosure of information about the\
   topology of the operator network that goes beyond the level of\
   disclosure explicit in SIP messages without this extension.\
   Consequently, operators need to ensure that the P-User-Database\
   header field is removed from requests before these are sent to\
   another administrative domain.\
