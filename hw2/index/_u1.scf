Abstract\
\
   We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or\
   more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6\
   connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo\
   service.  Running the service requires the help of "Teredo servers"\
   and "Teredo relays".  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have\
   to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the\
   Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the\
   "native" IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability\
   with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as "6to4".\

\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Classic tunneling methods envisaged for IPv6 transition operate by\
   sending IPv6 packets as payload of IPv4 packets; the 6to4 proposal\
   [RFC3056] proposes automatic discovery in this context.  A problem\
   with these methods is that they don't work when the IPv6 candidate\
   node is isolated behind a Network Address Translator (NAT) device:\
   NATs are typically not programmed to allow the transmission of\
   arbitrary payload types; even when they are, the local address cannot\
   be used in a 6to4 scheme. 6to4 will work with a NAT if the NAT and\
   6to4 router functions are in the same box; we want to cover the\
   relatively frequent case when the NAT cannot be readily upgraded to\
   provide a 6to4 router function.\
\
   A possible way to solve the problem is to rely on a set of "tunnel\
   brokers".  However, there are limits to any solution that is based on\
   such brokers: the quality of service may be limited, since the\
   traffic follows a dogleg route from the source to the broker and then\
   the destination; the broker has to provide sufficient transmission\
   capacity to relay all packets and thus suffers a high cost.  For\
   these two reasons, it may be desirable to have solutions that allow\
   for "automatic tunneling", i.e., let the packets follow a direct path\
   to the destination.\
\
   The automatic tunneling requirement is indeed at odds with some of\
   the specificities of NATs.  Establishing a direct path supposes that\
   the IPv6 candidate node can retrieve a "globally routable" address\
   that results from the translation of its local address by one or more\
   NATs; it also supposes that we can find a way to bypass the various\
   "per destination protections" that many NATs implement.  In this\
   memo, we will explain how IPv6 candidates located behind NATs use\
   "Teredo servers" to learn their "global address" and to obtain\
   connectivity, how they exchange packets with native IPv6 hosts\
   through "Teredo relays", and how clients, servers, and relays can be\
   organized in Teredo networks.\
\
   The specification is organized as follows.  Section 2 contains the\
   definition of the terms used in the memo.  Section 3 presents the\
   hypotheses on NAT behavior used in the design, as well as the\
   operational requirements that the design should meet.  Section 4\
   presents the IPv6 address format used by Teredo.  Section 5 contains\
   the format of the messages and the specification of the protocol.\
   Section 6 presents guidelines for further work on configured tunnels\
   that would be complementary to the current approach.  Section 7\
   contains a security discussion, section 8 contains a discussion of\
   the Unilateral Self Address Fixing (UNSAF) issues, and section 9\
   contains IANA considerations.\

\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   This specification uses the following definitions:\
\
2.1.  Teredo Service\
\
   The transmission of IPv6 packets over UDP, as defined in this memo.\
\
2.2.  Teredo Client\
\
   A node that has some access to the IPv4 Internet and wants to gain\
   access to the IPv6 Internet.\
\
2.3.  Teredo Server\
\
   A node that has access to the IPv4 Internet through a globally\
   routable address, and is used as a helper to provide IPv6\
   connectivity to Teredo clients.\
\
2.4.  Teredo Relay\
\
   An IPv6 router that can receive traffic destined to Teredo clients\
   and forward it using the Teredo service.\
\
2.5.  Teredo IPv6 Service Prefix\
\
   An IPv6 addressing prefix that is used to construct the IPv6 address\
   of Teredo clients.\
\
2.6.  Global Teredo IPv6 Service Prefix\
\
   An IPv6 addressing prefix whose value is 2001:0000:/32.\

\
2.8.  Teredo Bubble\
\
   A Teredo bubble is a minimal IPv6 packet, made of an IPv6 header and\
   a null payload.  The payload type is set to 59, No Next Header, as\
   per [RFC2460].  The Teredo clients and relays may send bubbles in\
   order to create a mapping in a NAT.\

\
\
2.9.  Teredo Service Port\
\
   The port from which the Teredo client sends Teredo packets.  This\
   port is attached to one of the client's IPv4 addresses.  The IPv4\
   address may or may not be globally routable, as the client may be\
   located behind one or more NAT.\
\
2.10.  Teredo Server Address\
\
   The IPv4 address of the Teredo server selected by a particular\
   client.\
\
2.11.  Teredo Mapped Address and Teredo Mapped Port\
\
   A global IPv4 address and a UDP port that results from the\
   translation of the IPv4 address and UDP port of a client's Teredo\
   service port by one or more NATs.  The client learns these values\
   through the Teredo protocol described in this memo.\
\
2.12.  Teredo IPv6 Client Prefix\
\
   A global scope IPv6 prefix composed of the Teredo IPv6 service prefix\
   and the Teredo server address.\
\
2.13.  Teredo Node Identifier\
\
   A 64-bit identifier that contains the UDP port and IPv4 address at\
   which a client can be reached through the Teredo service, as well as\
   a flag indicating the type of NAT through which the client accesses\
   the IPv4 Internet.\
\
2.14.  Teredo IPv6 Address\
\
   A Teredo IPv6 address obtained by combining a Teredo IPv6 client\
   prefix and a Teredo node identifier.\
\
2.15.  Teredo Refresh Interval\
\
   The interval during which a Teredo IPv6 address is expected to remain\
   valid in the absence of "refresh" traffic.  For a client located\
   behind a NAT, the interval depends on configuration parameters of the\
   local NAT, or the combination of NATs in the path to the Teredo\
   server.  By default, clients assume an interval value of 30 seconds;\
   a longer value may be determined by local tests, as described in\
   section 5.\

\
\
2.16.  Teredo Secondary Port\
\
   A UDP port used to send or receive packets in order to determine the\
   appropriate value of the refresh interval, but not used to carry any\
   Teredo traffic.\
\
2.17.  Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address\
\
   An IPv4 multicast address used to discover other Teredo clients on\
   the same IPv4 subnet.  The value of this address is 224.0.0.253.\
\
3.  Design Goals, Requirements, and Model of Operation\
\
   The proposed solution transports IPv6 packets as the payload of UDP\
   packets.  This is based on the observation that TCP and UDP are the\
   only protocols guaranteed to cross the majority of NAT devices.\
   Tunneling packets over TCP would be possible, but would result in a\
   poor quality of service; encapsulation over UDP is a better choice.\
\
   The design of our solution is based on a set of hypotheses and\
   observations on the behavior of NATs, our desire to provide an "IPv6\
   provider of last resort", and a list of operational requirements.  It\
   results in a model of operation in which the Teredo service is\
   enabled by a set of servers and relays.\
\
3.1.  Hypotheses about NAT Behavior\
\
   NAT devices typically incorporate some support for UDP, in order to\
   enable users in the natted domain to use UDP-based applications.  The\
   NAT will typically allocate a "mapping" when it sees a UDP packet\
   coming through for which there is not yet an existing mapping.  The\
   handling of UDP "sessions" by NAT devices differs by two important\
   parameters, the type and the duration of the mappings.\
\
   The type of mappings is analyzed in [RFC3489], which distinguishes\
   between "cone NAT", "restricted cone NAT", "port restricted cone NAT"\
   and "symmetric NAT".  The Teredo solution ensures connectivity for\
   clients located behind cone NATs, restricted cone NATs, or port-\
   restricted cone NATs.\
\
   Transmission of regular IPv6 packets only takes place after an\
   exchange of "bubbles" between the parties.  This exchange would often\
   fail for clients behind symmetric NAT, because their peer cannot\
   predict the UDP port number that the NAT expects.\
\
   Clients located behind a symmetric NAT will only be able to use\
   Teredo if they can somehow program the NAT and reserve a Teredo\
   service port for each client, for example, using the DMZ functions of\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   the NAT.  This is obviously an onerous requirement, at odds with the\
   design goal of an automatic solution.  However, measurement campaigns\
   and studies of documentations have shown that, at least in simple\
   "unmanaged" networks, symmetric NATs are a small minority; moreover,\
   it seems that new NAT models or firmware upgrades avoid the\
   "symmetric" design.\
\
   Investigations on the performance of [RFC3489] have shown the\
   relative frequency of a particular NAT design, which we might call\
   "port conserving".  In this design, the NAT tries to keep the same\
   port number inside and outside, unless the "outside" port number is\
   already in use for another mapping with the same host.  Port\
   conserving NAT appear as "cone" or "restricted cone NAT" most of the\
   time, but they will behave as "symmetric NAT" when multiple internal\
   hosts use the same port number to communicate to the same server.\
\
   The Teredo design minimizes the risk of encountering the "symmetric"\
   behavior by asking multiple hosts located behind the same NAT to use\
   different Teredo service ports.\
\
   Other investigation in the behavior of NAT also outlined the\
   "probabilistic rewrite" behavior.  Some brands of NAT will examine\
   all packets for "embedded addresses", IP addresses, and port numbers\
   present in application payloads.  They will systematically replace\
   32-bit values that match a local address by the corresponding mapped\
   address.  The Teredo specification includes an "obfuscation"\
   procedure in order to avoid this behavior.\
\
   Regardless of their types, UDP mappings are not kept forever.  The\
   typical algorithm is to remove the mapping if no traffic is observed\
   on the specified port for a "lifetime" period.  The Teredo client\
   that wants to maintain a mapping open in the NAT will have to send\
   some "keep alive" traffic before the lifetime expires.  For that, it\
   needs an estimate of the "lifetime" parameter used in the NAT.  We\
   observed that the implementation of lifetime control can vary in\
   several ways.\
\
   Most NATs implement a "minimum lifetime", which is set as a parameter\
   of the implementation.  Our observations of various boxes showed that\
   this parameter can vary between about 45 seconds and several minutes.\
\
   In many NATs, mappings can be kept for a duration that exceeds this\
   minimum, even in the absence of traffic.  We suspect that many\
   implementation perform "garbage collection" of unused mappings on\
   special events, e.g., when the overall number of mappings exceeds\
   some limit.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   In some cases, e.g., NATs that manage Integrated Services Digital\
   Network (ISDN) or dial-up connections, the mappings will be released\
   when the connection is released, i.e., when no traffic is observed on\
   the connection for a period of a few minutes.\
\
   Any algorithm used to estimate the lifetime of mapping will have to\
   be robust against these variations.\
\
   In some cases, clients are located behind multiple NAT.  The Teredo\
   procedures will ensure communications between clients between\
   multiple NATs and clients "on the other side" of these NATs.  They\
   will also ensure communication when clients are located in a single\
   subnet behind the same NAT.\
\
   The procedures do not make any hypothesis about the type of IPv4\
   address used behind a NAT, and in particular do not assume that these\
   are private addresses defined in [RFC1918].\
\
3.2.  IPv6 Provider of Last Resort\
\
   Teredo is designed to provide an "IPv6 access of last resort" to\
   nodes that need IPv6 connectivity but cannot use any of the other\
   IPv6 transition schemes.  This design objective has several\
   consequences on when to use Teredo, how to program clients, and what\
   to expect of servers.  Another consequence is that we expect to see a\
   point in time at which the Teredo technology ceases to be used.\
\
3.2.1.  When to Use Teredo\
\
   Teredo is designed to robustly enable IPv6 traffic through NATs, and\
   the price of robustness is a reasonable amount of overhead, due to\
   UDP encapsulation and transmission of bubbles.  Nodes that want to\
   connect to the IPv6 Internet SHOULD only use the Teredo service as a\
   "last resort" option: they SHOULD prefer using direct IPv6\
   connectivity if it is locally available, if it is provided by a 6to4\
   router co-located with the local NAT, or if it is provided by a\
   configured tunnel service; and they SHOULD prefer using the less\
   onerous 6to4 encapsulation if they can use a global IPv4 address.\
\
3.2.2.  Autonomous Deployment\
\
   In an IPv6-enabled network, the IPv6 service is configured\
   automatically, by using mechanisms such as IPv6 Stateless Address\
   Autoconfiguration [RFC2462] and Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461].  A\
   design objective is to configure the Teredo service as automatically\
   as possible.  In practice, however, it is required that the client\
   learn the IPv4 address of a server that is willing to serve the\
   client; some servers may also require some form of access control.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
3.2.3.  Minimal Load on Servers\
\
   During the peak of the transition, there will be a requirement to\
   deploy Teredo servers supporting a large number of Teredo clients.\
   Minimizing the load on the server is a good way to facilitate this\
   deployment.  To achieve this goal, servers should be as stateless as\
   possible, and they should also not be required to carry any more\
   traffic than necessary.  To achieve this objective, we require only\
   that servers enable the packet exchange between clients, but we don't\
   require servers to carry the actual data packets: these packets will\
   have to be exchanged directly between the Teredo clients, or through\
   a destination-selected relay for exchanges between Teredo clients and\
   other IPv6 clients.\
\
3.2.4.  Automatic Sunset\
\
   Teredo is meant as a short-term solution to the specific problem of\
   providing IPv6 service to nodes located behind a NAT.  The problem is\
   expected to be resolved over time by transforming the "IPv4 NAT" into\
   an "IPv6 router".  This can be done in one of two ways:  upgrading\
   the NAT to provide 6to4 functions or upgrading the Internet\
   connection used by the NAT to a native IPv6 service, and then adding\
   IPv6 router functionality in the NAT.  In either case, the former NAT\
   can present itself as an IPv6 router to the systems behind it.  These\
   systems will start receiving the "router advertisements"; they will\
   notice that they have IPv6 connectivity and will stop using Teredo.\
\
3.3.  Operational Requirements\
\
3.3.1.  Robustness Requirement\
\
   The Teredo service is designed primarily for robustness: packets are\
   carried over UDP in order to cross as many NAT implementations as\
   possible.  The servers are designed to be stateless, which means that\
   they can easily be replicated.  We expect indeed to find many such\
   servers replicated at multiple Internet locations.\
\
3.3.2.  Minimal Support Cost\
\
   The service requires the support of Teredo servers and Teredo relays.\
   In order to facilitate the deployment of these servers and relays,\
   the Teredo procedures are designed to minimize the amount of\
   coordination required between servers and relays.\
\
   Meeting this objective implies that the Teredo addresses will\
   incorporate the IPv4 address and UDP port through which a Teredo\
   client can be reached.  This creates an implicit limit on the\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   stability of the Teredo addresses, which can only remain valid as\
   long as the underlying IPv4 address and UDP port remain valid.\
\
3.3.3.  Protection against Denial of Service Attacks\
\
   The Teredo clients obtain mapped addresses and ports from the Teredo\
   servers.  The service must be protected against denial of service\
   attacks in which a third party spoofs a Teredo server and sends\
   improper information to the client.\
\
3.3.4.  Protection against Distributed Denial of Service Attacks\
\
   Teredo relays will act as a relay for IPv6 packets.  Improperly\
   designed packet relays can be used by denial of service attackers to\
   hide their address, making the attack untraceable.  The Teredo\
   service must include adequate protection against such misuse.\
\
3.3.5.  Compatibility with Ingress Filtering\
\
   Routers may perform ingress filtering by checking that the source\
   address of the packets received on a given interface is "legitimate",\
   i.e., belongs to network prefixes from which traffic is expected at a\
   network interface.  Ingress filtering is a recommended practice, as\
   it thwarts the use of forged source IP addresses by malfeasant\
   hackers, notably to cover their tracks during denial of service\
   attacks.  The Teredo specification must not force networks to disable\
   ingress filtering.\
\
3.4.  Model of Operation\
\
   The operation of Teredo involves four types of nodes: Teredo clients,\
   Teredo servers, Teredo relays, and "plain" IPv6 nodes.\
\
   Teredo clients start operation by interacting with a Teredo server,\
   performing a "qualification procedure".  During this procedure, the\
   client will discover whether it is behind a cone, restricted cone, or\
   symmetric NAT.  If the client is not located behind a symmetric NAT,\
   the procedure will be successful and the client will configure a\
   "Teredo address".\
\
   The Teredo IPv6 address embeds the "mapped address and port" through\
   which the client can receive IPv4/UDP packets encapsulating IPv6\
   packets.  If the client is not located behind a cone NAT,\
   transmission of regular IPv6 packets must be preceded by an exchange\
   of "bubbles" that will install a mapping in the NAT.  This document\
   specifies how the bubbles can be exchanged between Teredo clients in\
   order to enable transmission along a direct path.\

\
\
   Teredo clients can exchange IPv6 packets with plain IPv6 nodes (e.g.,\
   native nodes or 6to4 nodes) through Teredo relays.  Teredo relays\
   advertise reachability of the Teredo prefix to a certain subset of\
   the IPv6 Internet: a relay set up by an ISP will typically serve only\
   the IPv6 customers of this ISP; a relay set-up for a site will only\
   serve the IPv6 hosts of this site.  Dual-stack hosts may implement a\
   "local relay", allowing them to communicate directly with Teredo\
   hosts by sending IPv6 packets over UDP and IPv4 without having to\
   advertise a Teredo IPv6 address.\
\
   Teredo clients have to discover the relay that is closest to each\
   native IPv6 or 6to4 peer.  They have to perform this discovery for\
   each native IPv6 or 6to4 peer with which they communicate.  In order\
   to prevent spoofing, the Teredo clients perform a relay discovery\
   procedure by sending an ICMP echo request to the native host.  This\
   message is a regularly formatted IPv6 ICMP packet, which is\
   encapsulated in UDP and sent by the client to its Teredo server; the\
   server decapsulates the IPv6 message and forwards it to the intended\
   IPv6 destination.  The payload of the echo request contains a large\
   random number.  The echo reply is sent by the peer to the IPv6\
   address of the client, and is forwarded through standard IPv6 routing\
   mechanisms.  It will naturally reach the Teredo relay closest to the\
   native or 6to4 peer, and will be forwarded by this relay using the\
   Teredo mechanisms.  The Teredo client will discover the IPv4 address\
   and UDP port used by the relay to send the echo reply, and will send\
   further IPv6 packets to the peer by encapsulating them in UDP packets\
   sent to this IPv4 address and port.  In order to prevent spoofing,\
   the Teredo client verifies that the payload of the echo reply\
   contains the proper random number.\
\
   The procedures are designed so that the Teredo server only\
   participates in the qualification procedure and in the exchange of\
   bubbles and ICMP echo requests.  The Teredo server never carries\
   actual data traffic.  There are two rationales for this design:\
   reduce the load on the server in order to enable scaling, and avoid\
   privacy issues that could occur if a Teredo server kept copies of the\
   client's data packets.\
\
4.  Teredo Addresses\
\
   The Teredo addresses are composed of 5 components:\
\
   +-------------+-------------+-------+------+-------------+\
   | Prefix      | Server IPv4 | Flags | Port | Client IPv4 |\
   +-------------+-------------+-------+------+-------------+\
\
   - Prefix: the 32-bit Teredo service prefix.\
   - Server IPv4: the IPv4 address of a Teredo server.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   - Flags: a set of 16 bits that document type of address and NAT.\
   - Port: the obfuscated "mapped UDP port" of the Teredo service at\
     the client.\
   - Client IPv4: the obfuscated "mapped IPv4 address" of the client.\
\
   In this format, both the "mapped UDP port" and "mapped IPv4 address"\
   of the client are obfuscated.  Each bit in the address and port\
   number is reversed; this can be done by an exclusive OR of the 16-bit\
   port number with the hexadecimal value 0xFFFF, and an exclusive OR of\
   the 32-bit address with the hexadecimal value 0xFFFFFFFF.\
\
   The IPv6 addressing rules specify that "for all unicast addresses,\
   except those that start with binary value 000, Interface IDs are\
   required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64\
   format".  This dictates the encoding of the flags, 16 intermediate\
   bits that should correspond to valid values of the most significant\
   16 bits of a Modified EUI-64 ID:\
\
          0       0 0       1\
         |0       7 8       5\
         +----+----+----+----+\
         |Czzz|zzUG|zzzz|zzzz|\
         +----+----+----+----+\
\
   In this format:\
\
   -  The bits "UG" should be set to the value "00", indicating a non-\
      global unicast identifier;\
   -  The bit "C" (cone) should be set to 1 if the client believes it is\
      behind a cone NAT, to 0 otherwise; these values determine\
      different server behavior during the qualification procedure, as\
      specified in Section 5.2.1, as well as different bubble processing\
      by clients and relays.\
   -  The bits indicated with "z" must be set to zero and ignored on\
      receipt.\
\
   Thus, there are two currently specified values of the Flags field:\
   "0x0000" (all null) if the cone bit is set to 0, and "0x8000" if the\
   cone bit is set to 1.  (Further versions of this specification may\
   assign new values to the reserved bits.)\
\
   In some cases, Teredo nodes use link-local addresses.  These\
   addresses contain a link-local prefix (FE80::/64) and a 64-bit\
   identifier, constructed using the same format as presented above.  A\
   difference between link-local addresses and global addresses is that\
   the identifiers used in global addresses MUST include a global scope\
   unicast IPv4 address, while the identifiers used in link-local\
   addresses MAY include a private IPv4 address.\

\
5.  Specification of Clients, Servers, and Relays\
\
   The Teredo service is realized by having clients interact with Teredo\
   servers through the Teredo service protocol.  The clients will also\
   receive IPv6 packets through Teredo relays.  The client behavior is\
   specified in Section 5.2.\
\
   The Teredo server is designed to be stateless.  It waits for Teredo\
   requests and for IPv6 packets on the Teredo UDP port; it processes\
   the requests by sending a response to the appropriate address and\
   port; it forwards some Teredo IPv6 packets to the appropriate IPv4\
   address and UDP port, or to native IPv6 peers of Teredo clients.  The\
   precise behavior of the server is specified in Section 5.3.\
\
   The Teredo relay advertises reachability of the Teredo service prefix\
   over IPv6.  The scope of advertisement may be the entire Internet or\
   a smaller subset such as an ISP network or an IPv6 site; it may even\
   be as small as a single host in the case of "local relays".  The\
   relay forwards Teredo IPv6 packets to the appropriate IPv4 address\
   and UDP port.  The relay behavior is specified in Section 5.4.\
\
   Teredo clients, servers, and relays must implement the sunset\
   procedure defined in Section 5.5.\
\
5.1.  Message Formats\
\
5.1.1.  Teredo IPv6 Packet Encapsulation\
\
   Teredo IPv6 packets are transmitted as UDP packets [RFC768] within\
   IPv4 [RFC791].  The source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports\
   take values that are specified in this section.  Packets can come in\
   one of two formats, simple encapsulation and encapsulation with\
   origin indication.\
\
   When simple encapsulation is used, the packet will have a simple\
   format, in which the IPv6 packet is carried as the payload of a UDP\
   datagram:\
\
   +------+-----+-------------+\
   | IPv4 | UDP | IPv6 packet |\
   +------+-----+-------------+\
\
   When relaying some packets received from third parties, the server\
   may insert an origin indication in the first bytes of the UDP\
   payload:\
\
\
\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   +------+-----+-------------------+-------------+\
   | IPv4 | UDP | Origin indication | IPv6 packet |\
   +------+-----+-------------------+-------------+\
\
   The origin indication encapsulation is an 8-octet element, with the\
   following content:\
\
   +--------+--------+-----------------+\
   |  0x00  | 0x00   | Origin port #   |\
   +--------+--------+-----------------+\
   |  Origin IPv4 address              |\
   +-----------------------------------+\
\
   The first two octets of the origin indication are set to a null\
   value; this is used to discriminate between the simple encapsulation,\
   in which the first 4 bits of the packet contain the indication of the\
   IPv6 protocol, and the origin indication.\
\
   The following 16 bits contain the obfuscated value of the port number\
   from which the packet was received, in network byte order.  The next\
   32 bits contain the obfuscated IPv4 address from which the packet was\
   received, in network byte order.  In this format, both the original\
   "IPv4 address" and "UDP port" of the client are obfuscated.  Each bit\
   in the address and port number is reversed; this can be done by an\
   exclusive OR of the 16-bit port number with the hexadecimal value\
   0xFFFF, and an exclusive OR of the 32-bit address with the\
   hexadecimal value 0xFFFFFFFF.\
\
   For example, if the original UDP port number was 337 (hexadecimal\
   0151) and original IPv4 address was 1.2.3.4 (hexadecimal 01020304),\
   the origin indication would contain the value "0000FEAEFEFDFCFB".\
\
   When exchanging Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement\
   (RA) messages between a client and its server, the packets may\
   include an authentication parameter:\
\
   +------+-----+----------------+-------------+\
   | IPv4 | UDP | Authentication | IPv6 packet |\
   +------+-----+----------------+-------------+\
\
   The authentication encapsulation is a variable-length element,\
   containing a client identifier, an authentication value, a nonce\
   value, and a confirmation byte.\

   +--------------------------+--------+\
   |                          | Conf.  |\
   +--------------------------+--------+\
\
   The first octet of the authentication encapsulation is set to a null\
   value, and the second octet is set to the value 1; this enables\
   differentiation from IPv6 packets and from origin information\
   indication encapsulation.  The third octet indicates the length in\
   bytes of the client identifier; the fourth octet indicates the length\
   in bytes of the authentication value.  The computation of the\
   authentication value is specified in Section 5.2.2. The\
   authentication value is followed by an 8-octet nonce, and by a\
   confirmation byte.\
\
   Both ID-len and AU-len can be set to null values if the server does\
   not require an explicit authentication of the client.\
\
   Authentication and origin indication encapsulations may sometimes be\
   combined, for example, in the RA responses sent by the server.  In\
   this case, the authentication encapsulation MUST be the first element\
   in the UDP payload:\
\
   +------+-----+----------------+--------+-------------+\
   | IPv4 | UDP | Authentication | Origin | IPv6 packet |\
   +------+-----+----------------+--------+-------------+\
\
5.1.2.  Maximum Transmission Unit\
\
   Since Teredo uses UDP as an underlying transport, a Teredo Maximum\
   Transmission Unit (MTU) could potentially be as large as the payload\
   of the largest valid UDP datagram (65507 bytes).  However, since\
   Teredo packets can travel on unpredictable paths over the Internet,\
   it is best to contain this MTU to a small size, in order to minimize\
   the effect of IPv4 packet fragmentation and reassembly.  The default\
   link MTU assumed by a host, and the link MTU supplied by a Teredo\
   server during router advertisement SHOULD normally be set to the\
   minimum IPv6 MTU size of 1280 bytes [RFC2460].\

\
\
   Teredo implementations SHOULD NOT set the Don't Fragment (DF) bit of\
   the encapsulating IPv4 header.\
\
5.2.  Teredo Client Specification\
\
   Before using the Teredo service, the client must be configured with:\
\
   - the IPv4 address of a server.\
   - a secondary IPv4 address of that server.\
\
   If secure discovery is required, the client must also be configured\
   with:\
\
   - a client identifier,\
   - a secret value, shared with the server,\
   - an authentication algorithm, shared with the server.\
\
   A Teredo client expects to exchange IPv6 packets through a UDP port,\
   the Teredo service port.  To avoid problems when operating behind a\
   "port conserving" NAT, different clients operating behind the same\
   NAT should use different service port numbers.  This can be achieved\
   through explicit configuration or, in the absence of configuration,\
   by picking the service port number at random.\
\
   The client will maintain the following variables that reflect the\
   state of the Teredo service:\
\
   - Teredo connectivity status,\
   - Mapped address and port number associated with the Teredo service\
     port,\
   - Teredo IPv6 prefix associated with the Teredo service port,\
   - Teredo IPv6 address or addresses derived from the prefix,\
   - Link local address,\
   - Date and time of the last interaction with the Teredo server,\
   - Teredo Refresh Interval,\
   - Randomized Refresh Interval,\
   - List of recent Teredo peers.\
\
   Before sending any packets, the client must perform the Teredo\
   qualification procedure, which determines the Teredo connectivity\
   status, the mapped address and port number, and the Teredo IPv6\
   prefix.  It should then perform the cone NAT determination procedure,\
   which determines the cone NAT status and may alter the value of the\
   prefix.  If the qualification is successful, the client may use the\
   Teredo service port to transmit and receive IPv6 packets, according\
   to the transmission and reception procedures.  These procedures use\
   the "list of recent peers".  For each peer, the list contains:\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   - The IPv6 address of the peer,\
   - The mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP port of the peer,\
   - The status of the mapped address, i.e., trusted or not,\
   - The value of the last nonce sent to the peer,\
   - The date and time of the last reception from the peer,\
   - The date and time of the last transmission to the peer,\
   - The number of bubbles transmitted to the peer.\
\
   The list of peers is used to enable the transmission of IPv6 packets\
   by using a "direct path" for the IPv6 packets.  The list of peers\
   could grow over time.  Clients should implement a list management\
   strategy, for example, deleting the least recently used entries.\
   Clients should make sure that the list has a sufficient size, to\
   avoid unnecessary exchanges of bubbles.\
\
   The client must regularly perform the maintenance procedure in order\
   to guarantee that the Teredo service port remains usable.  The need\
   to use this procedure or not depends on the delay since the last\
   interaction with the Teredo server.  The refresh procedure takes as a\
   parameter the "Teredo refresh interval".  This parameter is initially\
   set to 30 seconds; it can be updated as a result of the optional\
   "interval determination procedure".  The randomized refresh interval\
   is set to a value randomly chosen between 75% and 100% of the refresh\
   interval.\
\
   In order to avoid triangle routing for stations that are located\
   behind the same NAT, the Teredo clients MAY use the optional local\
   client discovery procedure defined in Section 5.2.8. Using this\
   procedure will also enhance connectivity when the NAT cannot do\
   "hairpin" routing, i.e., cannot redirect a packet sent from one\
   internal host to the mapped address and port of another internal\
   host.\
\
5.2.1.  Qualification Procedure\
\
   The purposes of the qualification procedure are to establish the\
   status of the local IPv4 connection and to determine the Teredo IPv6\
   client prefix of the local Teredo interface.  The procedure starts\
   when the service is in the "initial" state, and it results in a\
   "qualified" state if successful, and in an "off-line" state if\
   unsuccessful.\

\
   Initially, the Teredo connectivity status is set to "Initial".\
\
   When the interface is initialized, the system first performs the\
   "start action" by sending a Router Solicitation message, as defined\
   in [RFC2461].  The client picks a link-local address and uses it as\
   the IPv6 source of the message; the cone bit in the address is set to\
   1 (see Section 4 for the address format); the IPv6 destination of the\
   RS is the all-routers multicast address; the packet will be sent over\
   UDP from the service port to the Teredo server's IPv4 address and\
   Teredo UDP port.  The connectivity status moves then to "Starting".\
\
   In the starting state, the client waits for a router advertisement\
   from the Teredo server.  If no response comes within a time-out T,\
   the client should repeat the start action, by resending the Router\
   Solicitation message.  If no response has arrived after N\
   repetitions, the client concludes that it is not behind a cone NAT.\
   It sets the cone bit to 0, and repeats the procedure.  If after N\
   other timer expirations and retransmissions there is still no\
   response, the client concludes that it cannot use UDP, and that the\
   Teredo service is not available; the status is set to "Off-line".  In\
   accordance with [RFC2461], the default time-out value is set to T=4\
   seconds, and the maximum number of repetitions is set to N=3.\
\
   If a response arrives, the client checks that the response contains\
   an origin indication and a valid router advertisement as defined in\
   [RFC2461], that the IPv6 destination address is equal to the link-\
   local address used in the router solicitation, and that the router\
   advertisement contains exactly one advertised Prefix Information\
   option.  This prefix should be a valid Teredo IPv6 server prefix: the\
   first 32 bits should contain the global Teredo IPv6 service prefix,\
   and the next 32 bits should contain the server's IPv4 address.  If\
   this is the case, the client learns the Teredo mapped address and\
   Teredo mapped port from the origin indication.  The IPv6 source\
   address of the Router Advertisement is a link-local server address of\
   the Teredo server.  (Responses that are not valid advertisements are\
   simply discarded.)\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   If the client has received an RA with the cone bit in the IPv6\
   destination address set to 1, it is behind a cone NAT and is fully\
   qualified.  If the RA is received with the cone bit set to 0, the\
   client does not know whether the local NAT is restricted or\
   symmetric.  The client selects the secondary IPv4 server address, and\
   repeats the procedure, the cone bit remaining to the value zero.  If\
   the client does not receive a response, it detects that the service\
   is not usable.  If the client receives a response, it compares the\
   mapped address and mapped port in this second response to the first\
   received values.  If the values are different, the client detects a\
   symmetric NAT: it cannot use the Teredo service.  If the values are\
   the same, the client detects a port-restricted or restricted cone\
   NAT: the client is qualified to use the service.  (Teredo operates\
   the same way for restricted and port-restricted NAT.)\
\
   If the client is qualified, it builds a Teredo IPv6 address using the\
   Teredo IPv6 server prefix learned from the RA and the obfuscated\
   values of the UDP port and IPv4 address learned from the origin\
   indication.  The cone bit should be set to the value used to receive\
   the RA, i.e., 1 if the client is behind a cone NAT, 0 otherwise.  The\
   client can start using the Teredo service.\
\
5.2.2.  Secure Qualification\
\
   The client may be required to perform secured qualification.  The\
   client will perform exactly the algorithm described in Section 5.2.1,\
   but it will incorporate an authentication encapsulation in the UDP\
   packet carrying the router solicitation message, and it will verify\
   the presence of a valid authentication parameter in the UDP message\
   that carries the router advertisement provided by the sender.\
\
   In these packets, the nonce value is chosen by the client, and is\
   repeated in the response from the server; the client identifier is a\
   value with which the client was configured.\
\
   A first level of protection is provided by just checking that the\
   value of the nonce in the response matches the value initially sent\
   by the client.  If they don't match, the packet MUST be discarded.\
   If no other protection is used, the authentication payload does not\
   contain any identifier or authentication field; the ID-len and AU-len\
   fields are set to a null value.  When stronger protection is\
   required, the authentication payload contains the identifier and\
   location fields, as explained in the following paragraphs.\
\
   The confirmation byte is set to 0 by the client.  A null value\
   returned by the server indicates that the client's key is still\
   valid; a non-null value indicates that the client should obtain a new\
   key.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   When stronger authentication is provided, the client and the server\
   are provisioned with a client identifier, a shared secret, and the\
   identification of an authentication algorithm.  Before transmission,\
   the authentication value is computed according to the specified\
   algorithm; on reception, the same algorithm is used to compute a\
   target value from the content of the receive packet.  The receiver\
   deems the authentication successful if the two values match.  If they\
   don't, the packet MUST be discarded.\
\
   To maximize interoperability, this specification defines a default\
   algorithm in which the authentication value is computed according the\
   HMAC specification [RFC2104] and the SHA1 function [FIPS-180].\
   Clients and servers may agree to use HMAC combined with a different\
   function, or to use a different algorithm altogether, such as for\
   example AES-XCBC-MAC-96 [RFC3566].\
\
   The default authentication algorithm is based on the HMAC algorithm\
   according to the following specifications:\
\
   - the hash function shall be the SHA1 function [FIPS-180].\
   - the secret value shall be the shared secret with which the client\
     was configured.\
\
   The clear text to be protected includes:\
\
   - the nonce value,\
   - the confirmation byte,\
   - the origin indication encapsulation, if it is present,\
   - the IPv6 packet.\
\
   The HMAC procedure is applied to the concatenation of these four\
   components, without any additional padding.\
\
5.2.3.  Packet Reception\
\
   The Teredo client receives packets over the Teredo interface.  The\
   role of the packet reception procedure, besides receiving packets, is\
   to maintain the date and time of the last interaction with the Teredo\
   server and the "list of recent peers".\
\
   When a UDP packet is received over the Teredo service port, the\
   Teredo client checks that it is encoded according to the packet\
   encoding rules defined in Section 5.1.1, and that it contains either\
   a valid IPv6 packet or the combination of a valid origin indication\
   encapsulation and a valid IPv6 packet, possibly protected by a valid\
   authentication encapsulation.  If this is not the case, the packet is\
   silently discarded.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   An IPv6 packet is deemed valid if it conforms to [RFC2460]: the\
   protocol identifier should indicate an IPv6 packet and the payload\
   length should be consistent with the length of the UDP datagram in\
   which the packet is encapsulated.  In addition, the client should\
   check that the IPv6 destination address correspond to its own Teredo\
   address.\
\
   Then, the Teredo client examines the IPv4 source address and UDP port\
   number from which the packet is received.  If these values match the\
   IPv4 address of the server and the Teredo port, the client updates\
   the "date and time of the last interaction with the Teredo server" to\
   the current date and time; if an origin indication is present, the\
   client should perform the "direct IPv6 connectivity test" described\
   in Section 5.2.9.\
\
   If the IPv4 source address and UDP port number are different from the\
   IPv4 address of the server and the Teredo port, the client examines\
   the IPv6 source address of the packet:\
\
   1) If there is an entry for the source IPv6 address in the list of\
   peers whose status is trusted, the client compares the mapped IPv4\
   address and mapped port in the entry with the source IPv4 address and\
   source port of the packet.  If the values match, the packet is\
   accepted; the date and time of the last reception from the peer is\
   updated.\
\
   2) If there is an entry for the source IPv6 address in the list of\
   peers whose status is not trusted, the client checks whether the\
   packet is an ICMPv6 echo reply.  If this is the case, and if the\
   ICMPv6 data of the reply matches the nonce stored in the peer entry,\
   the packet should be accepted; the status of the entry should be\
   changed to "trusted", the mapped IPv4 and mapped port in the entry\
   should be set to the source IPv4 address and source port from which\
   the packet was received, and the date and time of the last reception\
   from the peer should be updated.  Any packet queued for this IPv6\
   peer (as specified in Section 5.2.4) should be de-queued and\
   forwarded to the newly learned IPv4 address and UDP port.\
\
   3) If the source IPv6 address is a Teredo address, the client\
   compares the mapped IPv4 address and mapped port in the source\
   address with the source IPv4 address and source port of the packet.\
   If the values match, the client MUST create a peer entry for the IPv6\
   source address in the list of peers; it should update the entry if\
   one already existed; the mapped IPv4 address and mapped port in the\
   entry should be set to the value from which the packet was received,\
   and the status should be set to "trusted".  If a new entry is\
   created, the last transmission date is set to 30 seconds before the\
   current date, and the number of bubbles to zero.  If the packet is a\

\
\
   bubble, it should be discarded after this processing; otherwise, the\
   packet should be accepted.  In all cases, the client must de-queue\
   and forward any packet queued for that destination.\
\
   4) If the IPv4 destination address through which the packet was\
   received is the Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address, the source address is\
   a valid Teredo address, and the destination address is the "all nodes\
   on link" multicast address, the packet should be treated as a local\
   discovery bubble.  If no local entry already existed for the source\
   address, a new one is created, but its status is set to "not\
   trusted".  The client SHOULD reply with a unicast Teredo bubble, sent\
   to the source IPv4 address and source port of the local discovery\
   bubble; the IPv6 source address of the bubble will be set to local\
   Teredo IPv6 address; the IPv6 destination address of the bubble\
   should be set to the IPv6 source address of the local discovery\
   bubble.  (Clients that do not implement the optional local discovery\
   procedure will not process local discovery bubbles.)\
\
   5) If the source IPv6 address is a Teredo address, and the mapped\
   IPv4 address and mapped port in the source address do not match the\
   source IPv4 address and source port of the packet, the client checks\
   whether there is an existing "local" entry for that IPv6 address.  If\
   there is such an entry, and if the local IPv4 address and local port\
   indicated in that entry match the source IPv4 address and source\
\
   port of the packet, the client updates the "local" entry, whose\
   status should be set to "trusted".  If the packet is a bubble, it\
   should be discarded after this processing; otherwise, the packet\
   should be accepted.  In all cases, the client must de-queue and\
   forward any packet queued for that destination.\
\
   6) In the other cases, the packet may be accepted, but the client\
   should be conscious that the source address may be spoofed; before\
   processing the packet, the client should perform the "direct IPv6\
   connectivity test" described in Section 5.2.9.\
\
   Whatever the IPv4 source address and UDP source port, the client that\
   receives an IPv6 packet MAY send a Teredo bubble towards that target,\
   as specified in Section 5.2.6.\
\
5.2.4.  Packet Transmission\
\
   When a Teredo client has to transmit a packet over a Teredo\
   interface, it examines the destination IPv6 address.  The client\
   checks first if there is an entry for this IPv6 address in the list\
   of recent Teredo peers, and if the entry is still valid: an entry\
   associated with a local peer is valid if the last reception date and\
   time associated with that list entry is less that 30 seconds from the\

\
\
   current time; an entry associated with a non-local peer is valid if\
   the last reception date and time associated with that list entry is\
   less that 30 seconds from the current time.  (Local peer entries can\
   only be present if the client uses the local discovery procedure\
   discussed in Section 5.2.8.)\
\
   The client then performs the following:\
\
   1) If there is an entry for that IPv6 address in the list of peers,\
   and if the status of the entry is set to "trusted", the IPv6 packet\
   should be sent over UDP to the IPv4 address and UDP port specified in\
   the entry.  The client updates the date of last transmission in the\
   peer entry.\
\
   2) If the destination is not a Teredo IPv6 address, the packet is\
   queued, and the client performs the "direct IPv6 connectivity test"\
   described in Section 5.2.9. The packet will be de-queued and\
   forwarded if this procedure completes successfully.  If the direct\
   IPv6 connectivity test fails to complete within a 2-second time-out,\
   it should be repeated up to 3 times.\
\
   3) If the destination is the Teredo IPv6 address of a local peer\
   (i.e., a Teredo address from which a local discovery bubble has been\
   received in the last 600 seconds), the packet is queued.  The client\
   sends a unicast Teredo bubble to the local IPv4 address and local\
   port specified in the entry, and a local Teredo bubble to the Teredo\
   IPv4 discovery address.\
\
   4) If the destination is a Teredo IPv6 address in which the cone bit\
   is set to 1, the packet is sent over UDP to the mapped IPv4 address\
   and mapped UDP port extracted from that IPv6 address.\
\
   5) If the destination is a Teredo IPv6 address in which the cone bit\
   is set to 0, the packet is queued.  If the client is not located\
   behind a cone NAT, it sends a direct bubble to the Teredo\
   destination, i.e., to the mapped IP address and mapped port of the\
   destination.  In all cases, the client sends an indirect bubble to\
   the Teredo destination, sending it over UDP to the server address and\
   to the Teredo port.  The packet will be de-queued and forwarded when\
   the client receives a bubble or another packet directly from this\
   Teredo peer.  If no bubble is received within a 2-second time-out,\
   the bubble transmission should be repeated up to 3 times.\
\
   In cases 4 and 5, before sending a packet over UDP, the client MUST\
   check that the IPv4 destination address is in the format of a global\
   unicast address; if this is not the case, the packet MUST be silently\

\
   discarded.  (Note that a packet can legitimately be sent to a non-\
   global unicast address in case 1, as a result of the local discovery\
   procedure.)\
\
   The global unicast address check is designed to thwart a number of\
   possible attacks in which an attacker tries to use a Teredo host to\
   attack either a single local IPv4 target or a set of such targets.\
   For the purpose of this specification, and IPv4 address is deemed to\
   be a global unicast address if it does not belong to or match:\
\
   - the "local" subnet 0.0.0.0/8,\
   - the "loopback" subnet 127.0.0.0/8,\
   - the local addressing ranges 10.0.0.0/8,\
   - the local addressing ranges 172.16.0.0/12,\
   - the local addressing ranges 192.168.0.0/16,\
   - the link local block 169.254.0.0/16,\
   - the block reserved for 6to4 anycast addresses 192.88.99.0/24,\
   - the multicast address block 224.0.0.0/4,\
   - the "limited broadcast" destination address 255.255.255.255,\
   - the directed broadcast addresses corresponding to the subnets to\
     which the host is attached.\
\
   A list of special-use IPv4 addresses is provided in [RFC3330].\
\
   For reliability reasons, clients MAY decide to ignore the value of\
   the cone bit in the flag, skip the "case 4" test and always perform\
   the "case 5", i.e., treat all Teredo peers as if they were located\
   behind non-cone NAT.  This will result in some increase in traffic,\
   but may avoid reliability issues if the determination of the NAT\
   status was for some reason erroneous.  For the same reason, clients\
   MAY also decide to always send a direct bubble in case 5, even if\
   they do not believe that they are located behind a non-cone NAT.\
\
5.2.5.  Maintenance\
\
   The Teredo client must ensure that the mappings that it uses remain\
   valid.  It does so by checking that packets are regularly received\
   from the Teredo server.\
\
   At regular intervals, the client MUST check the "date and time of the\
   last interaction with the Teredo server" to ensure that at least one\
   packet has been received in the last Randomized Teredo Refresh\
   Interval.  If this is not the case, the client SHOULD send a router\
   solicitation message to the server, as specified in Section 5.2.1;\
   the client should use the same value of the cone bit that resulted in\
   the reception of an RA during the qualification procedure.\

\
\
   When the router advertisement is received, the client SHOULD check\
   its validity as specified in Section 5.2.1; invalid advertisements\
   are silently discarded.  If the advertisement is valid, the client\
   MUST check that the mapped address and port correspond to the current\
   Teredo address.  If this is not the case, the mapping has changed;\
   the client must mark the old address as invalid and start using the\
   new address.\
\
5.2.6.  Sending Teredo Bubbles\
\
   The Teredo client may have to send a bubble towards another Teredo\
   client, either after a packet reception or after a transmission\
   attempt, as explained in Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4. There are two\
   kinds of bubbles: direct bubbles, which are sent directly to the\
   mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP port of the peer, and indirect\
   bubbles, which are sent through the Teredo server of the peer.\
\
   When a Teredo client attempts to send a direct bubble, it extracts\
   the mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP port from the Teredo IPv6\
   address of the target.  It then checks whether there is already an\
   entry for this IPv6 address in the current list of peers.  If there\
   is no entry, the client MUST create a new list entry for the address,\
   setting the last reception date and the last transmission date to 30\
   seconds before the current date, and the number of bubbles to zero.\
\
   When a Teredo client attempts to send an indirect bubble, it extracts\
   the Teredo server IPv4 address from the Teredo prefix of the IPv6\
   address of the target (different clients may be using different\
   servers); the bubble will be sent to that IPv4 address and the Teredo\
   UDP port.\
\
   Bubbles may be lost in transit, and it is reasonable to enhance the\
   reliability of the Teredo service by allowing multiple transmissions;\
   however, bubbles will also be lost systematically in certain NAT\
   configurations.  In order to strike a balance between reliability and\
   unnecessary retransmissions, we specify the following:\
\
   - The client MUST NOT send a bubble if the last transmission date\
     and time is less than 2 seconds before the current date and time;\
\
   - The client MUST NOT send a bubble if it has already sent 4 bubbles\
     to the peer in the last 300 seconds without receiving a direct\
     response.\
\
   In the other cases, the client MAY proceed with the transmission of\
   the bubble.  When transmitting the bubble, the client MUST update the\
   last transmission date and time to that peer, and must also increment\
   the number of transmitted bubbles.\

\
\
5.2.7.  Optional Refresh Interval Determination Procedure\
\
   In addition to the regular client resources described in the\
   beginning of this section, the refresh interval determination\
   procedure uses an additional UDP port, the Teredo secondary port, and\
   the following variables:\
\
   - Teredo secondary connectivity status,\
   - Mapped address and port number of the Teredo secondary port,\
   - Teredo secondary IPv6 prefix associated with the secondary port,\
   - Teredo secondary IPv6 address derived from this prefix,\
   - Date and time of the last interaction on the secondary port,\
   - Maximum Teredo Refresh Interval.\
   - Candidate Teredo Refresh Interval.\
\
   The secondary connectivity status, mapped address and prefix are\
   determined by running the qualification procedure on the secondary\
   port.  When the client uses the interval determination procedure, the\
   qualification procedure MUST be run for the secondary port\
   immediately after running it on the service port.  If the secondary\
   qualification fails, the interval determination procedure will not be\
   used, and the interval value will remain to the default value, 30\
   seconds.  If the secondary qualification succeeds, the maximum\
   refresh interval is set to 120 seconds, and the candidate Teredo\
   refresh interval is set to 60 seconds, i.e., twice the Teredo refresh\
   interval.  The procedure is then performed at regular intervals,\
   until it concludes:\
\
   1) wait until the candidate refresh interval is elapsed after the\
      last interaction on the secondary port.\
\
   2) send a Teredo bubble to the Teredo secondary IPv6 address, through\
      the service port.\
\
   3) wait for reception of the bubble on the secondary port.  If a\
      timer of 2 seconds elapses without reception, repeat step 2 at\
      most three times.  If there is still no reception, the candidate\
      has failed; if there is a reception, the candidate has succeeded.\
\
   4) if the candidate has succeeded, set the Teredo refresh interval to\
      the candidate value, and set a new candidate value to the minimum\
      of twice the new refresh interval, or the average of the refresh\
      interval and the maximum refresh interval.\

\
\
   5) if the candidate has failed, set the maximum refresh interval to\
      the candidate value.  If the current refresh interval is larger\
      than or equal to 75% of the maximum, the determination procedure\
      has concluded; otherwise, set a new candidate value to the average\
      of the refresh interval and the maximum refresh interval.\
\
   6) if the procedure has not concluded, perform the maintenance\
      procedure on the secondary port, which will reset the date and\
      time of the last interaction on the secondary port, and may result\
      in the allocation of a new Teredo secondary IPv6 address; this\
      would not affect the values of the refresh interval, candidate\
      interval, or maximum refresh interval.\
\
   The secondary port MUST NOT be used for any other purpose than the\
   interval determination procedure.  It should be closed when the\
   procedure ends.\
\
5.2.8.  Optional Local Client Discovery Procedure\
\
   It is desirable to enable direct communication between Teredo clients\
   that are located behind the same NAT, without forcing a systematic\
   relay through a Teredo server.  It is hard to design a general\
   solution to this problem, but we can design a partial solution when\
   the Teredo clients are connected through IPv4 to the same link.\
\
   A Teredo client who wishes to enable local discovery SHOULD join the\
   IPv4 multicast group identified by Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address.\
   The client SHOULD wait for discovery bubbles to be received on the\
   Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address.  The client SHOULD send local\
   discovery bubbles to the Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address at random\
   intervals, uniformly distributed between 200 and 300 seconds.  A\
   local Teredo bubble has the following characteristics:\
\
   - IPv4 source address: the IPv4 address of the sender\
\
   - IPv4 destination address: the Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address\
\
   - IPv4 ttl: 1\
\
   - UDP source port: the Teredo service port of the sender\
\
   - UDP destination port: the Teredo UDP port\
\
   - UDP payload: a minimal IPv6 packet, as follows\
\
   - IPv6 source: the global Teredo IPv6 address of the sender\
\
   - IPv6 destination: the all-nodes on-link multicast address\

\
   - IPv6 payload type: 59 (No Next Header, as per [RFC2460])\
\
   - IPv6 payload length: 0\
\
   - IPv6 hop limit: 1\
\
   The local discovery procedure carries a denial of service risk, as\
   malevolent nodes could send fake bubbles to unsuspecting parties, and\
   thus capture the traffic originating from these parties.  The risk is\
   mitigated by the filtering rules described in Section 5.2.5, and also\
   by "link only" multicast scope of the Teredo IPv4 Discovery Address,\
   which implies that packets sent to this address will not be forwarded\
   across routers.\
\
   To benefit from the "link only multicast" protection, the clients\
   should silently discard all local discovery bubbles that are received\
   over a unicast address.  To further mitigate the denial of service\
   risk, the client MUST silently discard all local discovery bubbles\
   whose IPv6 source address is not a well-formed Teredo IPv6 address,\
   or whose IPv4 source address does not belong to the local IPv4\
   subnet; the client MAY decide to silently discard all local discovery\
   bubbles whose Teredo IPv6 address do not include the same mapped IPv4\
   address as its own.\
\
   If the bubble is accepted, the client checks whether there is an\
   entry in the list of recent peers that correspond to the mapped IPv4\
   address and mapped UDP port associated with the source IPv6 address\
   of the bubble.  If there is such an entry, the client MUST update the\
   local peer address and local peer port parameters to reflect the IPv4\
   source address and UDP source port of the bubble.  If there is no\
   entry, the client MUST create one, setting the local peer address and\
   local peer port parameters to reflect the IPv4 source address and UDP\
   source port of the bubble, the last reception date to the current\
   date and time, the last transmission date to 30 seconds before the\
   current date, and the number of bubbles to zero.  The state of the\
   entry is set to "not trusted".\
\
   Upon reception of a discovery bubble, clients reply with a unicast\
   bubble as specified in Section 5.2.3.\
\
5.2.9.  Direct IPv6 Connectivity Test\
\
   The Teredo procedures are designed to enable direct connections\
   between a Teredo host and a Teredo relay.  Teredo hosts located\
   behind a cone NAT will receive packets directly from relays; other\
   Teredo hosts will learn the original addresses and UDP ports of third\
   parties through the local Teredo server.  In all of these cases,\
   there is a risk that the IPv6 address of the source will be spoofed\

\
\
   by a malevolent party.  Teredo hosts must make two decisions, whether\
   to accept the packet for local processing and whether to transmit\
   further packets to the IPv6 address through the newly\
\
   learned IPv4 address and UDP port.  The basic rule is that the hosts\
   should be generous in what they accept and careful in what they send.\
   Refusing to accept packets due to spoofing concerns would compromise\
   connectivity and should only be done when there is a near certainty\
   that the source address is spoofed.  On the other hand, sending\
   packets to the wrong address should be avoided.\
\
   When the client wants to send a packet to a native IPv6 node or a\
   6to4 node, it should check whether a valid peer entry already exists\
   for the IPv6 address of the destination.  If this is not the case,\
   the client will pick a random number (a nonce) and format an ICMPv6\
   Echo Request message whose source is the local Teredo address, whose\
   destination is the address of the IPv6 node, and whose Data field is\
   set to the nonce.  (It is recommended to use a random number at least\
   64 bits long.)  The nonce value and the date at which the packet was\
   sent will be documented in a provisional peer entry for the IPV6\
   destination.  The ICMPv6 packet will then be sent encapsulated in a\
   UDP packet destined to the Teredo server IPv4 address and to the\
   Teredo port.  The rules of Section 5.2.3 specify how the reply to\
   this packet will be processed.\
\
5.2.10.  Working around symmetric NAT\
\
   The client procedures are designed to enable IPv6 connectivity\
   through the most common types of NAT, which are commonly called "cone\
   NAT" and "restricted cone NAT" [RFC3489].  Some NATs employ a\
   different design; they are often called "symmetric NAT".  The\
   qualification algorithm in Section 5.2.1 will not succeed when the\
   local NAT is a symmetric NAT.\
\
   In many cases, it is possible to work around the limitations of these\
   NATs by explicitly reserving a UDP port for Teredo service on a\
   client, using a function often called "DMZ" in the NAT's manual.\
   This port will become the "service port" used by the Teredo hosts.\
   The implementers of Teredo functions in hosts must make sure that the\
   value of the service port can be explicitly provisioned, so that the\
   user can provision the same value in the host and in the NAT.\
\
   The reservation procedure guarantees that the port mapping will\
   remain the same for all destinations.  After the explicit\
   reservation, the qualification algorithm in Section 5.2.1 will\
   succeed, and the Teredo client will behave as if behind a "cone NAT".\

\
\
   When different clients use Teredo behind a single symmetric NAT, each\
   of these clients must reserve and use a different service port.\
\
5.3.  Teredo Server Specification\
\
   The Teredo server is designed to be stateless.  The Teredo server\
   waits for incoming UDP packets at the Teredo Port, using the IPv4\
   address that has been selected for the service.  In addition, the\
   server is able to receive and transmit some packets using a different\
   IPv4 address and a different port number.\
\
   The Teredo server acts as an IPv6 router.  As such, it will receive\
   Router Solicitation messages, to which it will respond with Router\
   Advertisement messages as explained in Section 5.3.2.  It may also\
   receive other packets, for example, ICMPv6 messages and Teredo\
   bubbles, which are processed according to the IPv6 specification.\
\
   By default, the routing functions of the Teredo server are limited.\
   Teredo servers are expected to relay Teredo bubbles, ICMPv6 Echo\
   requests, and ICMPv6 Echo replies, but they are not expected to relay\
   other types of IPv6 packets.  Operators may, however, decide to\
   combine the functions of "Teredo server" and "Teredo relay", as\
   explained in Section 5.4.\
\
5.3.1.  Processing of Teredo IPv6 Packets\
\
   Before processing the packet, the Teredo server MUST check the\
   validity of the encapsulated IPv6 source address, the IPv4 source\
   address, and the UDP source port:\
\
   1)  If the UDP content is not a well-formed Teredo IPv6 packet, as\
   defined in Section 5.1.1, the packet MUST be silently discarded.\
\
   2)  If the UDP packet is not a Teredo bubble or an ICMPv6 message, it\
   SHOULD be discarded.  (The packet may be processed if the Teredo\
   server also operates as a Teredo relay, as explained in Section 5.4.)\
\
   3)  If the IPv4 source address is not in the format of a global\
   unicast address, the packet MUST be silently discarded (see Section\
   5.2.4 for a definition of global unicast addresses).\
\
   4)  If the IPv6 source address is an IPv6 link-local address, the\
   IPv6 destination address is the link-local scope all routers\
   multicast address (FF02::2), and the packet contains an ICMPv6 Router\
   Solicitation message, the packet MUST be accepted.  It MUST be\
   discarded if the server requires secure qualification and the\
   authentication encapsulation is absent or verification fails.\

\
\
   5)  If the IPv6 source address is a Teredo IPv6 address, and if the\
   IPv4 address and UDP port embedded in that address match the IPv4\
   source address and UDP source port, the packet SHOULD be accepted.\
\
   6)  If the IPv6 source address is not a Teredo IPv6 address, and if\
   the IPv6 destination address is a Teredo address allocated through\
   this server, the packet SHOULD be accepted.\
\
   7)  In all other cases, the packet MUST be silently discarded.\
\
   The Teredo server will then check the IPv6 destination address of the\
   encapsulated IPv6 packet:\
\
   If the IPv6 destination address is the link-local scope all routers\
   multicast address (FF02::2), or the link-local address of the server,\
   the Teredo server processes the packet; it may have to process Router\
   Solicitation messages and ICMPv6 Echo Request messages.\
\
   If the destination IPv6 address is not a global scope IPv6 address,\
   the packet MUST NOT be forwarded.\
\
   If the destination address is not a Teredo IPv6 address, the packet\
   should be relayed to the IPv6 Internet using regular IPv6 routing.\
\
   If the IPv6 destination address is a valid Teredo IPv6 address as\
   defined in Section 2.13, the Teredo Server MUST check that the IPv4\
   address derived from this IPv6 address is in the format of a global\
   unicast address; if this is not the case, the packet MUST be silently\
   discarded.\
\
   If the address is valid, the Teredo server encapsulates the IPv6\
   packet in a new UDP datagram, in which the following parameters are\
   set:\
\
   - The destination IPv4 address is derived from the IPv6 destination.\
\
   - The source IPv4 address is the Teredo server IPv4 address.\
\
   - The destination UDP port is derived from the IPv6 destination.\
\
   - The source UDP port is set to the Teredo UDP Port.\
\
   If the destination IPv6 address is a Teredo client whose address is\
   serviced by this specific server, the server should insert an origin\
   indication in the first bytes of the UDP payload, as specified in\
   Section 5.1.1.  (To verify that the client is served by this server,\
   the server compares bits 32-63 of the client's Teredo IPv6 address to\
   the server's IPv4 address.)\

\
\
5.3.2.  Processing of Router Solicitations\
\
   When the Teredo server receives a Router Solicitation message (RS,\
   [RFC2461]), it retains the IPv4 address and UDP port from which the\
   solicitation was received; these become the Teredo mapped address and\
   Teredo mapped port of the client.  The router uses these values to\
   compose the origin indication encapsulation that will be sent with\
   the response to the solicitation.\
\
   The Teredo server responds to the router solicitation by sending a\
   Router Advertisement message [RFC2461].  The router advertisement\
   MUST advertise the Teredo IPv6 prefix composed from the service\
\
   prefix and the server's IPv4 address.  The IPv6 source address should\
   be set to a Teredo link-local server address associated to the local\
   interface; this address is derived from the IPv4 address of the\
   server and from the Teredo port, as specified in Section 4; the cone\
   bit is set to 1.  The IPv6 destination address is set to the IPv6\
   source address of the RS.  The Router Advertisement message must be\
   sent over UDP to the Teredo mapped address and Teredo mapped port of\
   the client; the IPv4 source address and UDP source port should be set\
   to the server's IPv4 address and Teredo Port.  If the cone bit of the\
   client's IPv6 address is set to 1, the RA must be sent from a\
   different IPv4 source address than the server address over which the\
   RS was received; if the cone bit is set to zero, the response must be\
   sent back from the same address.\
\
   Before sending the packet, the Teredo server MUST check that the IPv4\
   destination address is in the format of a global unicast address; if\
   this is not the case, the packet MUST be silently discarded (see\
   Section 5.2.4 for a definition of global unicast addresses).\
\
   If secure qualification is required, the server MUST insert a valid\
   authentication parameter in the UDP packet carrying the router\
   advertisement.  The client identifier and the nonce value used in the\
   authentication parameter MUST be the same identifier and nonce as\
   received in the router solicitation.  The confirmation byte MUST be\
   set to zero if the client identifier is still valid, and a non-null\
   value otherwise; the authentication value SHOULD be computed using\
   the secret that corresponds to the client identifier.\
\
5.4.  Teredo Relay Specification\
\
   Teredo relays are IPv6 routers that advertise reachability of the\
   Teredo service IPv6 prefix through the IPv6 routing protocols.  (A\
   minimal Teredo relay may serve just a local host, and would not\
   advertise the prefix beyond this host.)  Teredo relays will receive\
   IPv6 packets bound to Teredo clients.  Teredo relays should be able\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   to receive packets sent over IPv4 and UDP by Teredo clients; they may\
   apply filtering rules, e.g., only accept packets from Teredo clients\
   if they have previously sent traffic to these Teredo clients.\
\
   The receiving and sending rules used by Teredo relays are very\
   similar to those of Teredo clients.  Teredo relays must use a Teredo\
   service port to transmit packets to Teredo clients; they must\
   maintain a "list of peers", identical to the list of peers maintained\
   by Teredo clients.\
\
5.4.1.  Transmission by Relays to Teredo Clients\
\
   When a Teredo relay has to transmit a packet to a Teredo client, it\
   examines the destination IPv6 address.  By definition, the Teredo\
   relays will only send over UDP IPv6 packets whose IPv6 destination\
   address is a valid Teredo IPv6 address.\
\
   Before processing these packets, the Teredo Relay MUST check that the\
   IPv4 destination address embedded in the Teredo IPv6 address is in\
   the format of a global unicast address; if this is not the case, the\
   packet MUST be silently discarded (see Section 5.2.4 for a definition\
   of global unicast addresses).\
\
   The relay then checks if there is an entry for this IPv6 address in\
   the list of recent Teredo peers, and if the entry is still valid.\
   The relay then performs the following:\
\
   1) If there is an entry for that IPv6 address in the list of peers,\
   and if the status of the entry is set to "trusted", the IPv6 packet\
   should be sent over UDP to the mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP\
   port of the entry.  The relay updates the date of last transmission\
   in the peer entry.\
\
   2) If there is no trusted entry in the list of peers, and if the\
   destination is a Teredo IPv6 address in which the cone bit is set to\
   1, the packet is sent over UDP to the mapped IPv4 address and mapped\
   UDP port extracted from that IPv6 address.\
\
   3) If there is no trusted entry in the list of peers, and if the\
   destination is a Teredo IPv6 address in which the cone bit is set to\
   0, the Teredo relay creates a bubble whose source address is set to a\
   local IPv6 address, and whose destination address is set to the\
   Teredo IPv6 address of the packet's destination.  The bubble is sent\
   to the server address corresponding to the Teredo destination.  The\
   entry becomes trusted when a bubble or another packet is received\
   from this IPv6 address; if no such packet is received before a time-\
   out of 2 seconds, the Teredo relay may repeat the bubble, up to three\
   times.  If the relay fails to receive a bubble after these\

\
\
   repetitions, the entry is removed from the list of peers.  The relay\
   MAY queue packets bound to untrusted entries; the queued packets\
   SHOULD be de-queued and forwarded when the entry becomes trusted;\
   they SHOULD be deleted if the entry is deleted.  To avoid denial of\
   service attacks, the relays SHOULD limit the number of packets in\
   such queues.\
\
   In cases 2 and 3, the Teredo relay should create a peer entry for the\
   IPv6 address; the entry status is marked as trusted in case 2 (cone\
   NAT) and not trusted in case 3.  In case 3, if the Teredo relay\
   happens to be located behind a non-cone NAT, it should also send a\
   bubble directly to the mapped IPv4 address and mapped port number of\
   the Teredo destination.  This will "open the path" for the return\
   bubble from the Teredo client.\
\
   For reliability reasons, relays MAY decide to ignore the value of the\
   cone bit in the flag, and always perform the "case 3", i.e., treat\
   all Teredo peers as if they were located behind a non-cone NAT.  This\
   will result in some increase in traffic, but may avoid\
\
   reliability issues if the determination of the NAT status was for\
   some reason erroneous.  For the same reason, relays MAY also decide\
   to always send a direct bubble to the mapped IPv4 address and mapped\
   port number of the Teredo destination, even if they do not believe\
   that they are located behind a non-cone NAT.\
\
5.4.2.  Reception from Teredo Clients\
\
   The Teredo relay may receive packets from Teredo clients; the packets\
   should normally only be sent by clients to which the relay previously\
   transmitted packets, i.e., clients whose IPv6 address is present in\
   the list of peers.  Relays, like clients, use the packet reception\
   procedure to maintain the date and time of the last interaction with\
   the Teredo server and the "list of recent peers".\
\
   When a UDP packet is received over the Teredo service port, the\
   Teredo relay checks that it contains a valid IPv6 packet as specified\
   in [RFC2460].  If this is not the case, the packet is silently\
   discarded.\
\
   Then, the Teredo relay examines whether the IPv6 source address is a\
   valid Teredo address, and if the mapped IPv4 address and mapped port\
   match the IPv4 source address and port number from which the packet\
   is received.  If this is not the case, the packet is silently\
   discarded.\
\
   The Teredo relay then examines whether there is an entry for the IPv6\
   source address in the list of recent peers.  If this is not the case,\

\
\
   the packet may be silently discarded.  If this is the case, the entry\
   status is set to "trusted"; the relay updates the "date and time of\
   the last interaction" to the current date and time.\
\
   Finally, the relay examines the destination IPv6 address.  If the\
   destination belongs to a range of IPv6 addresses served by the relay,\
   the packet SHOULD be accepted and forwarded to the destination.  In\
   the other cases, the packet SHOULD be silently discarded.\
\
5.4.3.  Difference between Teredo Relays and Teredo Servers\
\
   Because Teredo servers can relay Teredo packets over IPv6, all Teredo\
   servers must be capable of behaving as Teredo relays.  There is,\
   however, no requirement that Teredo relays behave as Teredo servers.\
\
   The dual role of server and relays implies an additional complexity\
   for the programming of servers: the processing of incoming packets\
   should be a combination of the server processing rules defined in\
   Section 5.3.1, and the relay processing rules defined in Section\
   5.4.2.  (Section 5.3 only specifies the rules implemented by a pure\
   server, not a combination relay+server.)\
\
5.5.  Implementation of Automatic Sunset\
\
   Teredo is designed as an interim transition mechanism, and it is\
   important that it should not be used any longer than necessary.  The\
   "sunset" procedure will be implemented by Teredo clients, servers,\
   and relays, as specified in this section.\
\
   The Teredo-capable nodes MUST NOT behave as Teredo clients if they\
   already have IPv6 connectivity through any other means, such as\
   native IPv6 connectivity.  In particular, nodes that have a global\
   IPv4 address SHOULD obtain connectivity through the 6to4 service\
   rather than through the Teredo service.  The classic reason why a\
   node that does not need connectivity would still enable the Teredo\
   service is to guarantee good performance when interacting with Teredo\
   clients; however, a Teredo-capable node that has IPv4 connectivity\
   and that has obtained IPv6 connectivity outside the Teredo service\
   MAY decide to behave as a Teredo relay, and still obtain good\
   performance when interacting with Teredo clients.\
\
   The Teredo servers are expected to participate in the sunset\
   procedure by announcing a date at which they will stop providing the\
   service.  This date depends on the availability of alternative\
   solutions to their clients, such as "dual-mode" gateways that behave\
   simultaneously as IPv4 NATs and IPv6 routers.  Most Teredo servers\
   will not be expected to operate more than a few years.  Teredo relays\
   are expected to have the same life span as Teredo servers.\

\
6.  Further Study, Use of Teredo to Implement a Tunnel Service\
\
   Teredo defines a NAT traversal solution that can be provided using\
   very little resource at the server.  Ongoing IETF discussions have\
   outlined the need for both a solution like Teredo and a more\
   controlled NAT traversal solution, using configured tunnels to a\
   service provider [RFC3904].  This section provides a tentative\
   analysis of how Teredo could be extended to also support a configured\
   tunnel service.\
\
   It may be possible to design a tunnel server protocol that is\
   compatible with Teredo, in the sense that the same client could be\
   used either in the Teredo service or with a tunnel service.  In fact,\
   this could be done by configuring the client with:\
\
   - The IPv4 address of a Teredo server that acts as a tunnel broker\
   - A client identifier\
   - A shared secret with that server\
   - An agreed-upon authentication algorithm.\
\
   The Teredo client would use the secure qualification procedure, as\
   specified in Section 5.2.2. Instead of returning a Teredo prefix in\
   the router advertisement, the server would return a globally routable\
   IPv6 prefix; this prefix could be permanently assigned to the client,\
   which would provide the client with a stable address.  The server\
   would have to keep state, i.e., memorize the association between the\
   prefix assigned to the client and the mapped IPv4 address and mapped\
   UDP port of the client.\
\
   The Teredo server would advertise reachability of the client prefix\
   to the IPv6 Internet.  Any packet bound to that prefix would be\
   transmitted to the mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP port of the\
   client.\
\
   The Teredo client, when it receives the prefix, would notice that\
   this prefix is a global IPv6 prefix, not in the form of a Teredo\
   prefix.  The client would at that point recognize that it should\
   operate in tunnel mode.  A client that operates in tunnel mode would\
   execute a much simpler transmission procedure: it would forward any\
   packet sent to the Teredo interface to the IPv4 address and Teredo\
   UDP port of the server.\
\
   The Teredo client would have to perform the maintenance procedure\
   described in Section 5.2.5. The server would receive the router\
   solicitation, and could notice a possible change of mapped IPv4\
   address and mapped UDP port that could result from the\
   reconfiguration of the mappings inside the NAT.  The server should\
   continue advertising the same IPv6 prefix to the client, and should\

\
\
   update the mapped IPv4 address and mapped UDP port associated to this\
   prefix, if necessary.\
\
   There is as yet no consensus that a tunnel-mode extension to Teredo\
   should be developed.  This section is only intended to provide\
   suggestions to the future developers of such services.  Many details\
   would probably have to be worked out before a tunnel-mode extension\
   would be agreed upon.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The main objective of Teredo is to provide nodes located behind a NAT\
   with a globally routable IPv6 address.  The Teredo nodes can use IP\
   security (IPsec) services such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE),\
   Authentication Header (AH), or Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)\
   [RFC4306, RFC4302, RFC4303], without the configuration restrictions\
   still present in "Negotiation of NAT-Traversal in the IKE" [RFC3947].\
   As such, we can argue that the service has a positive effect on\
   network security.  However, the security analysis must also envisage\
   the negative effects of the Teredo services, which we can group in\
   four categories: security risks of directly connecting a node to the\
   IPv6 Internet, spoofing of Teredo servers to enable a man-in-the-\
   middle attack, potential attacks aimed at denying the Teredo service\
   to a Teredo client, and denial of service attacks against non-Teredo\
   participating nodes that would be enabled by the Teredo service.\
\
   In the following, we review in detail these four types of issues, and\
   we present mitigating strategies for each of them.\
\
7.1.  Opening a Hole in the NAT\
\
   The very purpose of the Teredo service is to make a machine reachable\
   through IPv6.  By definition, the machine using the service will give\
   up whatever firewall service was available in the NAT box, however\
   limited this service may be [RFC2993].  The services that listen to\
   the Teredo IPv6 address will become the potential target of attacks\
   from the entire IPv6 Internet.  This may sound scary, but there are\
   three mitigating factors.\
\
   The first mitigating factor is the possibility to restrict some\
   services to only accept traffic from local neighbors, e.g., using\
   link-local addresses.  Teredo does not support communication using\
   link-local addresses.  This implies that link-local services will not\
   be accessed through Teredo, and will be restricted to whatever other\
   IPv6 connectivity may be available, e.g., direct traffic with\
   neighbors on the local link, behind the NAT.\

\
\
   The second mitigating factor is the possible use of a "local\
   firewall" solution, i.e., a piece of software that performs locally\
   the kind of inspection and filtering that is otherwise performed in a\
   perimeter firewall.  Using such software is recommended.\
\
   The third mitigating factor is the availability of IP security\
   (IPsec) services such as IKE, AH, or ESP [RFC4306, RFC4302, RFC4303].\
   Using these services in conjunction with Teredo is a good policy, as\
   it will protect the client from possible attacks in intermediate\
   servers such as the NAT, the Teredo server, or the Teredo relay.\
   (However, these services can be used only if the parties in the\
   communication can negotiate a key, which requires agreeing on some\
   credentials; this is known to be a hard problem.)\
\
7.2.  Using the Teredo Service for a Man-in-the-Middle Attack\
\
   The goal of the Teredo service is to provide hosts located behind a\
   NAT with a globally reachable IPv6 address.  There is a possible\
   class of attacks against this service in which an attacker somehow\
   intercepts the router solicitation, responds with a spoofed router\
   advertisement, and provides a Teredo client with an incorrect\
   address.  The attacker may have one of two objectives: it may try to\
   deny service to the Teredo client by providing it with an address\
   that is in fact unreachable, or it may try to insert itself as a\
   relay for all client communications, effectively enabling a variety\
   of "man-in-the-middle" attack.\
\
7.2.1.  Attacker Spoofing the Teredo Server\
\
   The simple nonce verification procedure described in Section 5.2.2\
   provides a first level of protection against attacks in which a third\
   party tries to spoof the server.  In practice, the nonce procedure\
   can be defeated only if the attacker is "on path".\
\
   If client and server share a secret and agree on an authentication\
   algorithm, the secure qualification procedure described in Section\
   5.2.2 provides further protection.  To defeat this protection, the\
   attacker could try to obtain a copy of the secret shared between\
   client and server.  The most likely way to obtain the shared secret\
   is to listen to the traffic and mount an offline dictionary attack;\
   to protect against this attack, the secret shared between client and\
   server should contain sufficient entropy.  (This probably requires\
   some automated procedure for provisioning the shared secret and the\
   algorithm.)\
\
   If the shared secret contains sufficient entropy, the attacker would\
   have to defeat the one-way function used to compute the\
   authentication value.  This specification suggests a default\

\
\
   algorithm combining HMAC and MD5.  If the protection afforded by MD5\
   was not deemed sufficient, clients and servers can agree to use a\
   different algorithm, e.g., SHA1.\
\
   Another way to defeat the protection afforded by the authentication\
   procedure is to mount a complex attack, as follows:\
\
   1) Client prepares router solicitation, including authentication\
   encapsulation.\
\
   2) Attacker intercepts the solicitation, and somehow manages to\
   prevent it from reaching the server, for example, by mounting a\
   short-duration DoS attack against the server.\
\
   3) Attacker replaces the source IPv4 address and source UDP port of\
   the request by one of its own addresses and port, and forwards the\
   modified request to the server.\
\
   4) Server dutifully notes the IPv4 address from which the packet is\
   received, verifies that the Authentication encapsulation is correct,\
   prepares a router advertisement, signs it, and sends it back to the\
   incoming address, i.e., the attacker.\
\
   5) Attacker receives the advertisement, takes note of the mapping,\
   replaces the IPv4 address and UDP port by the original values in the\
   intercepted message, and sends the response to the client.\
\
   6) Client receives the advertisement, notes that the authentication\
   header is present and is correct, and uses the proposed prefix and\
   the mapped addresses in the origin indication encapsulation.\
\
   The root cause of the problem is that the NAT is, in itself, a man-\
   in-the-middle attack.  The Authentication encapsulation covers the\
   encapsulated IPv6 packet, but does not cover the encapsulating IPv4\
   header and UDP header.  It is very hard to devise an effective\
   authentication scheme, since the attacker does not do anything else\
   than what the NAT legally does!\
\
   However, there are several mitigating factors that lead us to avoid\
   worrying too much about this attack.  In practice, the gain from the\
   attack is either to deny service to the client or to obtain a "man-\
   in-the-middle" position.  However, in order to mount the attack, the\
   attacker must be able to suppress traffic originating from the\
   client, i.e., have denial of service capability; the attacker must\
   also be able to observe the traffic exchanged between client and\
   inject its own traffic in the mix, i.e., have man-in-the-middle\
   capacity.  In summary, the attack is very hard to mount, and the gain\
   for the attacker in terms of "elevation of privilege" is minimal.\

\
\
   A similar attack is described in detail in the security section of\
   [RFC3489].\
\
7.2.2.  Attacker Spoofing a Teredo Relay\
\
   An attacker may try to use Teredo either to pass itself for another\
   IPv6 host or to place itself as a man-in-the-middle between a Teredo\
   host and a native IPv6 host.  The attacker will mount such attacks by\
   spoofing a Teredo relay, i.e., by convincing the Teredo host that\
   packets bound to the native IPv6 host should be relayed to the IPv4\
   address of the attacker.\
\
   The possibility of the attack derives from the lack of any\
   algorithmic relation between the IPv4 address of a relay and the\
   native IPv6 addresses served by these relay.  A Teredo host cannot\
   decide just by looking at the encapsulating IPv4 and UDP header\
   whether or not a relay is legitimate.  If a Teredo host decided to\
   simply trust the incoming traffic, it would easily fall prey to a\
   relay-spoofing attack.\
\
   The attack is mitigated by the "direct IPv6 connectivity test"\
   specified in Section 5.2.9. The test specifies a relay discovery\
   procedure secured by a nonce.  The nonce is transmitted from the\
   Teredo host to the destination through Teredo server, which the\
   client normally trusts.  The response arrives through the "natural"\
   relay, i.e., the relay closest to the IPv6 destination.  Sending\
   traffic to this relay will place it out of reach of attackers that\
   are not on the direct path between the Teredo host and its IPv6 peer.\
\
   End-to-end security protections are required to defend against\
   spoofing attacks if the attacker is on the direct path between the\
   Teredo host and its peer.\
\
7.2.3.  End-to-End Security\
\
   The most effective line of defense of a Teredo client is probably not\
   to try to secure the Teredo service itself: even if the mapping can\
   be securely obtained, the attacker would still be able to listen to\
   the traffic and send spoofed packets.  Rather, the Teredo client\
   should realize that, because it is located behind a NAT, it is in a\
\
   situation of vulnerability; it should systematically try to encrypt\
   its IPv6 traffic, using IPsec.  Even if the IPv4 and UDP headers are\
   vulnerable, the use of IPsec will effectively prevent spoofing and\
   listening of the IPv6 packets by third parties.  By providing each\
   client with a global IPv6 address, Teredo enables the use of IPsec\

   of NAT-Traversal in the IKE" [RFC3947] and ultimately enhances the\
   security of these clients.\
\
7.3.  Denial of the Teredo service\
\
   Our analysis outlines five ways to attack the Teredo service.  There\
   are countermeasures for each of these attacks.\
\
7.3.1.  Denial of Service by a Rogue Relay\
\
   An attack can be mounted on the IPv6 side of the service by setting\
   up a rogue relay and letting that relay advertise a route to the\
   Teredo IPv6 prefix.  This is an attack against IPv6 routing, which\
   can also be mitigated by the same kind of procedures used to\
   eliminate spurious route advertisements.  Dual-stack nodes that\
   implement "host local" Teredo relays are impervious to this attack.\
\
7.3.2.  Denial of Service by Server Spoofing\
\
   In Section 7.2, we discussed the use of spoofed router advertisements\
   to insert an attacker in the middle of a Teredo conversation.  The\
   spoofed router advertisements can also be used to provision a client\
   with an incorrect address, pointing to either a non-existing IPv4\
   address or the IPv4 address of a third party.\
\
   The Teredo client will detect the attack when it fails to receive\
   traffic through the newly acquired IPv6 address.  The attack can be\
   mitigated by using the authentication encapsulation.\
\
7.3.3.  Denial of Service by Exceeding the Number of Peers\
\
   A Teredo client manages a cache of recently used peers, which makes\
   it stateful.  It is possible to mount an attack against the client by\
   provoking it to respond to packets that appear to come from a large\
   number of Teredo peers, thus trashing the cache and effectively\
   denying the use of direct communication between peers.  The effect\
   will last only as long as the attack is sustained.\
\
7.3.4.  Attacks against the Local Discovery Procedure\
\
   There is a possible denial of service attack against the local peer\
   discovery procedure, if attackers can manage to send spoofed local\
   discovery bubbles to a Teredo client.  The checks described in\
   Section 5.2.8 mitigate this attack.  Clients who are more interested\
   in security than in performance could decide to disable the local\
   discovery procedure; however, if local discovery is disabled, traffic\
   between local nodes will end up being relayed through a server\

\
\
   external to the local network, which has questionable security\
   implications.\
\
7.3.5.  Attacking the Teredo Servers and Relays\
\
   It is possible to mount a brute force denial of service attack\
   against the Teredo servers by sending them a very large number of\
   packets.  This attack will have to be brute force, since the servers\
   are stateless, and can be designed to process all the packets that\
   are sent on their access line.\
\
   The brute force attack against the Teredo servers is mitigated if\
   clients are ready to "failover" to another server.  Bringing down the\
   servers will, however, force the clients that change servers to\
   renumber their Teredo address.\
\
   It is also possible to mount a brute force attack against a Teredo\
   relay.  This attack is mitigated if the relay under attack stops\
   announcing the reachability of the Teredo service prefix to the IPv6\
   network: the traffic will be picked up by the next relay.\
\
   An attack similar to that described in Section 7.3.2 can be mounted\
   against a relay.  An IPv6 host can send IPv6 packets to a large\
   number of Teredo destinations, forcing the relay to establish state\
   for each of these destinations.  Teredo relays can obtain some\
   protection by limiting the range of IPv6 clients that they serve, and\
   by limiting the amount of state used for "new" peers.\
\
7.4.  Denial of Service against Non-Teredo Nodes\
\
   There is a widely expressed concern that transition mechanisms such\
   as Teredo can be used to mount denial of service attacks, by\
   injecting traffic at locations where it is not expected.  These\
   attacks fall in three categories: using the Teredo servers as a\
   reflector in a denial of service attack, using the Teredo server to\
   carry a denial of service attack against IPv6 nodes, and using the\
   Teredo relays to carry a denial of service attack against IPv4 nodes.\
   The analysis of these attacks follows.  A common mitigating factor in\
   all cases is the "regularity" of the Teredo traffic, which contains\
   highly specific patterns such as the Teredo UDP port, or the Teredo\
   IPv6 prefix.  In case of attacks, these patterns can be used to\
   quickly install filters and remove the offending traffic.\
\
   We should also note that none of the listed possibilities offer any\
   noticeable amplification.\

\
\
7.4.1.  Laundering DoS attacks from IPv4 to IPv4\
\
   An attacker can use the Teredo servers as reflectors in a denial of\
   service attack aimed at an IPv4 target.  The attacker can do this in\
   one of two ways.  The first way is to construct a Router Solicitation\
\
   message and post it to a Teredo server, using as IPv4 source address\
   the spoofed address of the target; the Teredo server will then send a\
   Router advertisement message to the target.  The second way is to\
   construct a Teredo IPv6 address using the Teredo prefix, the address\
   of a selected server, the IPv4 of the target, and an arbitrary UDP\
   port, and to then send packets bound to that address to the selected\
   Teredo server.\
\
   Reflector attacks are discussed in [REFLECT], which outlines various\
   mitigating techniques against such attacks.  One of these mitigations\
   is to observe that "the traffic generated by the reflectors [has]\
   sufficient regularity and semantics that it can be filtered out near\
   the victim without the filtering itself constituting a denial-of-\
   service to the victim ('collateral damage')".  The traffic reflected\
   by the Teredo servers meets this condition: it is clearly\
   recognizable, since it originates from the Teredo UDP port; it can be\
   filtered out safely if the target itself is not a Teredo user.  In\
   addition, the packets relayed by servers will carry an Origin\
   indication encapsulation, which will help determine the source of the\
   attack.\
\
7.4.2.  DoS Attacks from IPv4 to IPv6\
\
   An attacker may use the Teredo servers to launch a denial of service\
   attack against an arbitrary IPv6 destination.  The attacker will\
   build an IPv6 packet bound for the target and will send that packet\
   to the IPv4 address and UDP port of a Teredo server, to be relayed\
   from there to the target over IPv6.\
\
   The address checks specified in Section 5.3.1 provide some protection\
   against this attack, as they ensure that the IPv6 source address will\
   be consistent with the IPv4 source address and UDP source port used\
   by the attacker: if the attacker cannot spoof the IPv4 source\
   address, the target will be able to determine the origin of the\
   attack.\
\
   The address checks ensure that the IPv6 source address of packets\
   forwarded by servers will start with the IPv6 Teredo prefix.  This is\
   a mitigating factor, as sites under attack could use this to filter\
   out all packets sourced from that prefix during an attack.  This will\
   result in a partial loss of service, as the target will not be able\
   to communicate with legitimate Teredo hosts that use the same prefix.\

\
\
   However, the communication with other IPv6 hosts will remain\
   unaffected, and the communication with Teredo hosts will be able to\
   resume when the attack has ceased.\
\
7.4.3.  DoS Attacks from IPv6 to IPv4\
\
   An attacker with IPv6 connectivity may use the Teredo relays to\
   launch a denial of service attack against an arbitrary IPv4\
   destination.  The attacker will compose a Teredo IPv6 address using\
   the Teredo prefix, a "cone" flag set to 1, the IPv4 address of the\
   target, and an arbitrary UDP port.\
\
   In the simplest variation of this attack, the attacker sends IPv6\
   packets to the Teredo destination using regular IPv6 routing.  The\
   packets are picked by the nearest relay, which will forward them to\
   the IPv4 address of the target.  In a more elaborate variant, the\
   attacker tricks a Teredo into sending packets to the target, either\
   by sending a first packet with a spoofed IPv6 address and letting the\
   Teredo host reply or by publishing a spoofed IPv6 address in a name\
   service.\
\
   There are three types of IPv4 addresses that an attacker may embed in\
   the spoofed Teredo address.  It may embed a multicast or broadcast\
   address, an local unicast address, or a global unicast address.\
\
   With multicast or broadcast addresses, the attacker can use the\
   multiplying effect of multicast routing.  By sending a single packet,\
   it can affect a large number of hosts, in a way reminiscent of the\
   "smurf" attack.\
\
   By using local addresses, the attacker can reach hosts that are not\
   normally reachable from the Internet, for example, hosts connected to\
   the a Teredo relay by a private subnet.  This creates an exposure\
   for, at a minimum, a denial of service attack against these otherwise\
   protected hosts.  This is similar to attack variants using source\
   routing to breach a perimeter.\
\
   The address checks specified in Section 5.2.4, 5.3.1, and 5.4.1\
   verify that packets are relayed only to a global IPv4 address.  They\
   are designed to eliminate the possibility of using broadcast,\
   multicast or local addresses in denial of service or other attacks.\
   In what follows, we will only consider attacks targeting globally\
   reachable unicast addresses.\

RFC 4380                         Teredo                    February 2006\
\
\
   The attacks can be targeted at arbitrary UDP ports, such as, for\
   example, the DNS port of a server.  The UDP payload must be a well-\
   formed IPv6 packet, and is thus unlikely to be accepted by any well-\
   written UDP service; in most case, the only effect of the attack will\
   be to overload the target with random traffic.\
\
   A special case occurs if the attack is directed to an echo service.\
   The service will echo the packets.  Since the echo service sees the\
   request coming from the IPv4 address of the relay, the echo replies\
   will be sent back to the same relay.  According to the rules\
   specified in Section 5.4, these packets will be discarded by the\
   Teredo relay.  This is not a very efficient attack against the Teredo\
   relays -- establishing a legitimate session with an actual Teredo\
   host would create more traffic.\
\
   The IPv6 packets sent to the target contain the IPv6 address used by\
   the attacker.  If ingress filtering is used in the IPv6 network, this\
\
   address will be hard to spoof.  If ingress filtering is not used, the\
   attacker can be traced if the IPv6 routers use a mechanism similar to\
   ICMP Traceback.  The ICMP messages will normally be collected by the\
   same relays that forward the traffic from the attacker; the relays\
   can use these messages to identify the source of an ongoing attack.\
   The details of this solution will have to be developed in further\
   research.\
\
8.  IAB Considerations\
\
   The IAB has studied the problem of "Unilateral Self Address Fixing"\
   (UNSAF), which is the general process by which a client attempts to\
   determine its address in another realm on the other side of a NAT\
   through a collaborative protocol reflection mechanism [RFC3424].\
   Teredo is an example of a protocol that performs this type of\
   function.  The IAB has mandated that any protocols developed for this\
   purpose document a specific set of considerations.  This section\
   meets those requirements.\
\
8.1.  Problem Definition\
\
   From [RFC3424], any UNSAF proposal must provide a precise definition\
   of a specific, limited-scope problem that is to be solved with the\
   UNSAF proposal.  A short-term fix should not be generalized to solve\
   other problems; this is why "short term fixes usually aren't".\
\
   The specific problem being solved by Teredo is the provision of IPv6\
   connectivity for hosts that cannot obtain IPv6 connectivity natively\
   and cannot make use of 6to4 because of the presence of a NAT between\
   them and the 6to4 relays.\

\
\
8.2.  Exit Strategy\
\
   From [RFC3424], any UNSAF proposal must provide the description of an\
   exit strategy/transition plan.  The better short term fixes are the\
   ones that will naturally see less and less use as the appropriate\
   technology is deployed.\
\
   Teredo comes with its own built-in exit strategy: as soon as a client\
   obtains IPv6 connectivity by other means, either 6to4 or native IPv6,\
   it can cease using the Teredo service.  In particular, we expect that\
   the next generation of home routers will provide an IPv6 service in\
   complement to the current IPv4 NAT service, e.g., by relaying\
   connectivity obtained from the ISP, or by using a configured or\
   automatic tunnel service.\
\
   As long as Teredo is used, there will be a need to support Teredo\
   relays so that the remaining Teredo hosts can communicate with native\
   IPv6 hosts.  As Teredo usage declines, the traffic load on the relays\
   will decline.  Over time, managers will observe a reduced traffic\
   load on their relays and will turn them off, effectively increasing\
   the pressure on the remaining Teredo hosts to upgrade to another form\
   of connectivity.\
\
   The exit strategy is facilitated by the nature of Teredo, which\
   provides an IP-level solution.  IPv6-aware applications do not have\
   to be updated to use or not use Teredo.  The absence of impact on the\
   applications makes it easier to migrate out of Teredo: network\
   connectivity suffices.\
\
   There would appear to be reasons why a Teredo implementation might\
   decide to continue usage of the Teredo service even if it already has\
   obtained connectivity by some other means, for example:\
\
   1. When a client is dual homed, and it wishes to improve the service\
   when communicating with other Teredo hosts that are "nearby" on the\
   IPv4 network.  If the client only used its native IPv6 service, the\
   Teredo hosts would be reached only through the relay.  By maintaining\
   Teredo, the Teredo hosts can be reached by direct transmission over\
   IPv4.\
\
   2. If, for some reason, the Teredo link is providing the client with\
   better service than the native IPv6 link, in terms of bandwidth,\
   packet loss, etc.\
\
   The design of Teredo mitigates the dual-homing reason.  A host that\
   wishes to communicate with Teredo peers can implement a "host-based\
   relay", which is effectively an unnumbered Teredo interface.  As\
   such, the dual-homed host will obtain Teredo connectivity with those\

\
\
   hosts that must use Teredo, but will not inadvertently encourage\
   other dual-homed hosts to keep using the Teredo service.\
\
   The bubbles and the UDP encapsulation used by Teredo introduce a\
   significant overhead.  It would take exceptional circumstances for\
   native technologies to provide a lesser service than Teredo.  These\
   exceptional circumstances, or other unforeseen reasons, may induce\
   hosts to keep using the Teredo service despite the availability of\
   native IPv6 connectivity.  However, these circumstances are likely to\
   be rare and transient.  Moreover, if the primary reason to use Teredo\
   fades away, one can expect that Teredo relays will be progressively\
   turned off and that the quality of the Teredo service will\
   progressively degrade, reducing the motivation to use the Teredo\
   service.\

8.3.  Brittleness Introduced by Teredo\
\
   From [RFC3424], any UNSAF proposal must provide a discussion of\
   specific issues that may render systems more "brittle".  For example,\
   approaches that involve using data at multiple network layers create\
   more dependencies, increase debugging challenges, and make it harder\
   to transition.\
\
   Teredo introduces brittleness into the system in several ways: the\
   discovery process assumes a certain classification of devices based\
   on their treatment of UDP; the mappings need to be continuously\
   refreshed; and addressing structure may cause some hosts located\
   behind a common NAT to be unreachable from each other.\
\
   There are many similarities between these points and those introduced\
   by Simple Traversal of the UDP Protocol through NAT (STUN) [RFC3489];\
   however, Teredo is probably somewhat less brittle than STUN.  The\
   reason is that all Teredo packets are sent from the local IPv4 Teredo\
   service port, including discovery, bubbles, and actual encapsulated\
   packets.  This is different from STUN, where NAT type detection and\
   binding allocation use different local ports (ephemeral, in both\
   cases).\
\
   Teredo assumes a certain classification of devices based on their\
   treatment of UDP (e.g., cone, protected cone and symmetric).  There\
   could be devices that would not fit into one of these molds, and\
   hence would be improperly classified by Teredo.\
\
   The bindings allocated from the NAT need to be continuously\
   refreshed.  Since the timeouts for these bindings are very\
   implementation specific, the refresh interval cannot easily be\
\

\
\
   determined.  When the binding is not being actively used to receive\
   traffic, but to wait for an incoming message, the binding refresh\
   will needlessly consume network bandwidth.\
\
   The use of the Teredo server as an additional network element\
   introduces another point of potential security attack.  These attacks\
   are largely prevented by the security measures provided by Teredo,\
   but not entirely.\
\
   The use of the Teredo server as an additional network element\
   introduces another point of failure.  If the client cannot locate a\
   Teredo server, or if the server should be unavailable due to failure,\
   the Teredo client will not be able to obtain IPv6 connectivity.\
\
   The communication with non-Teredo hosts relies on the availability of\
   Teredo relays.  The Teredo design assumes that there are multiple\
   Teredo relays; the Teredo service will discover the relay closest to\
   the non-Teredo peer.  If that relay becomes unavailable, or is\
   misbehaving, communication between the Teredo hosts and the peers\
   close to that relay will fail.  This reliability issue is somewhat\
   mitigated by the possibility to deploy many relays, arbitrarily close\
   from the native IPv6 hosts that require connectivity with Teredo\
   peers.\
\
   Teredo imposes some restrictions on the network topologies for proper\
   operation.  In particular, if the same NAT is on the path between two\
   clients and the Teredo server, these clients will only be able to\
   interoperate if they are connected to the same link, or if the common\
   NAT is capable of "hairpinning", i.e., "looping" packets sent by one\
   client to another.\
\
   There are also additional points of brittleness that are worth\
   mentioning:\
\
   - Teredo service will not work through NATs of the symmetric variety.\
\
   - Teredo service depends on the Teredo server running on a network\
     that is a common ancestor to all Teredo clients; typically, this is\
     the public Internet.  If the Teredo server is itself behind a NAT,\
     Teredo service will not work to certain peers.\
\
   - Teredo introduces jitter into the IPv6 service it provides, due to\
     the queuing of packets while bubble exchanges take place.  This\
     jitter can negatively impact applications, particularly latency\
     sensitive ones, such as Voice over IP (VoIP).\

\
8.4.  Requirements for a Long-Term Solution\
\
   From [RFC3424], any UNSAF proposal must identify requirements for\
   longer-term, sound technical solutions -- contribute to the process\
   of finding the right longer-term solution.\
\
   Our experience with Teredo has led to the following requirements for\
   a long-term solution to the NAT problem: the devices that implement\
   the IPv4 NAT services should in the future also become IPv6 routers.\

9.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This memo documents a request to IANA to allocate a 32-bit Teredo\
   IPv6 service prefix, as specified in Section 2.6, and a Teredo IPv4\
   multicast address, as specified in Section 2.17.\

Abstract\
\
   This document provides an analysis grid to evaluate, compare, and\
   contrast the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)\
   protocol suite capabilities with the recovery mechanisms currently\
   proposed at the IETF CCAMP Working Group.  A detailed analysis of\
   each of the recovery phases is provided using the terminology defined\
   in RFC 4427.  This document focuses on transport plane survivability\
   and recovery issues and not on control plane resilience and related\
   aspects.\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document provides an analysis grid to evaluate, compare, and\
   contrast the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite capabilities\
   with the recovery mechanisms proposed at the IETF CCAMP Working\
   Group.  The focus is on transport plane survivability and recovery\
   issues and not on control-plane-resilience-related aspects.  Although\
   the recovery mechanisms described in this document impose different\
   requirements on GMPLS-based recovery protocols, the protocols'\
   specifications will not be covered in this document.  Though the\
   concepts discussed are technology independent, this document\
   implicitly focuses on SONET [T1.105]/SDH [G.707], Optical Transport\
   Networks (OTN) [G.709], and pre-OTN technologies, except when\
   specific details need to be considered (for instance, in the case of\
   failure detection).\
\
   A detailed analysis is provided for each of the recovery phases as\
   identified in [RFC4427].  These phases define the sequence of generic\
   operations that need to be performed when a LSP/Span failure (or any\
   other event generating such failures) occurs:\
\
      - Phase 1: Failure Detection\
      - Phase 2: Failure Localization (and Isolation)\
      - Phase 3: Failure Notification\
      - Phase 4: Recovery (Protection or Restoration)\
      - Phase 5: Reversion (Normalization)\
\
   Together, failure detection, localization, and notification phases\
   are referred to as "fault management".  Within a recovery domain, the\
   entities involved during the recovery operations are defined in\
   [RFC4427]; these entities include ingress, egress, and intermediate\
   nodes.  The term "recovery mechanism" is used to cover both\
   protection and restoration mechanisms.  Specific terms such as\
   "protection" and "restoration" are used only when differentiation is\
   required.  Likewise the term "failure" is used to represent both\
   signal failure and signal degradation.\
\
   In addition, when analyzing the different hierarchical recovery\
   mechanisms including disjointness-related issues, a clear distinction\
   is made between partitioning (horizontal hierarchy) and layering\
   (vertical hierarchy).  In order to assess the current GMPLS protocol\
   capabilities and the potential need for further extensions, the\
   dimensions for analyzing each of the recovery mechanisms detailed in\
   this document are introduced.  This document concludes by detailing\
   the applicability of the current GMPLS protocol building blocks for\
   recovery purposes.\

   [RFC3473], [RFC4202], and [RFC4204].\
\
4.  Fault Management\
\
4.1.  Failure Detection\
\
   Transport failure detection is the only phase that cannot be achieved\
   by the control plane alone because the latter needs a hook to the\
   transport plane in order to collect the related information.  It has\
   to be emphasized that even if failure events themselves are detected\
   by the transport plane, the latter, upon a failure condition, must\
   trigger the control plane for subsequent actions through the use of\
   GMPLS signaling capabilities (see [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]) or Link\
   Management Protocol capabilities (see [RFC4204], Section 6).\
\
   Therefore, by definition, transport failure detection is transport\
   technology dependent (and so exceptionally, we keep here the\
   "transport plane" terminology).  In transport fault management,\
   distinction is made between a defect and a failure.  Here, the\
   discussion addresses failure detection (persistent fault cause).  In\
   the technology-dependent descriptions, a more precise specification\
   will be provided.\
\
   As an example, SONET/SDH (see [G.707], [G.783], and [G.806]) provides\
   supervision capabilities covering:\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   - Continuity: SONET/SDH monitors the integrity of the continuity of a\
     trail (i.e., section or path).  This operation is performed by\
     monitoring the presence/absence of the signal.  Examples are Loss\
     of Signal (LOS) detection for the physical layer, Unequipped (UNEQ)\
     Signal detection for the path layer, Server Signal Fail Detection\
     (e.g., AIS) at the client layer.\
\
   - Connectivity: SONET/SDH monitors the integrity of the routing of\
     the signal between end-points.  Connectivity monitoring is needed\
     if the layer provides flexible connectivity, either automatically\
     (e.g., cross-connects) or manually (e.g., fiber distribution\
     frame).  An example is the Trail (i.e., section or path) Trace\
     Identifier used at the different layers and the corresponding Trail\
     Trace Identifier Mismatch detection.\
\
   - Alignment: SONET/SDH checks that the client and server layer frame\
     start can be correctly recovered from the detection of loss of\
     alignment.  The specific processes depend on the signal/frame\
     structure and may include: (multi-)frame alignment, pointer\
     processing, and alignment of several independent frames to a common\
     frame start in case of inverse multiplexing.  Loss of alignment is\
     a generic term.  Examples are loss of frame, loss of multi-frame,\
     or loss of pointer.\
\
   - Payload type: SONET/SDH checks that compatible adaptation functions\
     are used at the source and the destination.  Normally, this is done\
     by adding a payload type identifier (referred to as the "signal\
     label") at the source adaptation function and comparing it with the\
     expected identifier at the destination.  For instance, the payload\
     type identifier is compared with the corresponding mismatch\
     detection.\
\
   - Signal Quality: SONET/SDH monitors the performance of a signal.\
     For instance, if the performance falls below a certain threshold, a\
     defect -- excessive errors (EXC) or degraded signal (DEG) -- is\
     detected.\
\
   The most important point is that the supervision processes and the\
   corresponding failure detection (used to initiate the recovery\
   phase(s)) result in either:\
\
   - Signal Degrade (SD): A signal indicating that the associated data\
     has degraded in the sense that a degraded defect condition is\
     active (for instance, a dDEG declared when the Bit Error Rate\
     exceeds a preset threshold).  Or\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   - Signal Fail (SF): A signal indicating that the associated data has\
     failed in the sense that a signal interrupting near-end defect\
     condition is active (as opposed to the degraded defect).\
\
   In Optical Transport Networks (OTN), equivalent supervision\
   capabilities are provided at the optical/digital section layers\
   (i.e., Optical Transmission Section (OTS), Optical Multiplex Section\
   (OMS) and Optical channel Transport Unit (OTU)) and at the\
   optical/digital path layers (i.e., Optical Channel (OCh) and Optical\
   channel Data Unit (ODU)).  Interested readers are referred to the\
   ITU-T Recommendations [G.798] and [G.709] for more details.\
\
   The above are examples that illustrate cases where the failure\
   detection and reporting entities (see [RFC4427]) are co-located.  The\
   following example illustrates the scenario where the failure\
   detecting and reporting entities (see [RFC4427]) are not co-located.\
\
   In pre-OTN networks, a failure may be masked by intermediate O-E-O\
   based Optical Line System (OLS), preventing a Photonic Cross-Connect\
   (PXC) from detecting upstream failures.  In such cases, failure\
   detection may be assisted by an out-of-band communication channel,\
   and failure condition may be reported to the PXC control plane.  This\
   can be provided by using [RFC4209] extensions that deliver IP\
   message-based communication between the PXC and the OLS control\
   plane.  Also, since PXCs are independent of the framing format,\
   failure conditions can only be triggered either by detecting the\
   absence of the optical signal or by measuring its quality.  These\
   mechanisms are generally less reliable than electrical (digital)\
   ones.  Both types of detection mechanisms are outside the scope of\
   this document.  If the intermediate OLS supports electrical (digital)\
   mechanisms, using the LMP communication channel, these failure\
   conditions are reported to\
\
   the PXC and subsequent recovery actions are performed as described in\
   Section 5.  As such, from the control plane viewpoint, this mechanism\
   turns the OLS-PXC-composed system into a single logical entity, thus\
   having the same failure management mechanisms as any other O-E-O\
   capable device.\
\
   More generally, the following are typical failure conditions in\
   SONET/SDH and pre-OTN networks:\
\
   - Loss of Light (LOL)/Loss of Signal (LOS): Signal Failure (SF)\
     condition where the optical signal is not detected any longer on\
     the receiver of a given interface.\
\
   - Signal Degrade (SD): detection of the signal degradation over\
     a specific period of time.\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   - For SONET/SDH payloads, all of the above-mentioned supervision\
     capabilities can be used, resulting in SD or SF conditions.\
\
   In summary, the following cases apply when considering the\
   communication between the detecting and reporting entities:\
\
   - Co-located detecting and reporting entities: both the detecting and\
     reporting entities are on the same node (e.g., SONET/SDH equipment,\
     Opaque cross-connects, and, with some limitations, Transparent\
     cross-connects, etc.)\
\
   - Non-co-located detecting and reporting entities:\
\
     o with in-band communication between entities: entities are\
       physically separated, but the transport plane provides in-band\
       communication between them (e.g., Server Signal Failures such as\
       Alarm Indication Signal (AIS), etc.)\
\
     o with out-of-band communication between entities: entities are\
       physically separated, but an out-of-band communication channel is\
       provided between them (e.g., using [RFCF4204]).\
\
4.2.  Failure Localization and Isolation\
\
   Failure localization provides information to the deciding entity\
   about the location (and so the identity) of the transport plane\
   entity that detects the LSP(s)/span(s) failure.  The deciding entity\
   can then make an accurate decision to achieve finer grained recovery\
   switching action(s).  Note that this information can also be included\
   as part of the failure notification (see Section 4.3).\
\
   In some cases, this accurate failure localization information may be\
   less urgent to determine if it requires performing more time-\
   consuming failure isolation (see also Section 4.4).  This is\
   particularly the case when edge-to-edge LSP recovery is performed\
   based on a simple failure notification (including the identification\
   of the working LSPs under failure condition).  Note that "edge"\
   refers to a sub-network end-node, for instance.  In this case, a more\
   accurate localization and isolation can be performed after recovery\
   of these LSPs.\
\
   Failure localization should be triggered immediately after the fault\
   detection phase.  This operation can be performed at the transport\
   plane and/or (if the operation is unavailable via the transport\
   plane) the control plane level where dedicated signaling messages can\
   be used.  When performed at the control plane level, a protocol such\
   as LMP (see [RFC4204], Section 6) can be used for failure\
   localization purposes.\

\
\
4.3.  Failure Notification\
\
   Failure notification is used 1) to inform intermediate nodes that an\
   LSP/span failure has occurred and has been detected and 2) to inform\
   the deciding entities (which can correspond to any intermediate or\
   end-point of the failed LSP/span) that the corresponding service is\
   not available.  In general, these deciding entities will be the ones\
   making the appropriate recovery decision.  When co-located with the\
   recovering entity, these entities will also perform the corresponding\
   recovery action(s).\
\
   Failure notification can be provided either by the transport or by\
   the control plane.  As an example, let us first briefly describe the\
   failure notification mechanism defined at the SONET/SDH transport\
   plane level (also referred to as maintenance signal supervision):\
\
   - AIS (Alarm Indication Signal) occurs as a result of a failure\
     condition such as Loss of Signal and is used to notify downstream\
     nodes (of the appropriate layer processing) that a failure has\
     occurred.  AIS performs two functions: 1) inform the intermediate\
     nodes (with the appropriate layer monitoring capability) that a\
     failure has been detected and 2) notify the connection end-point\
     that the service is no longer available.\
\
   For a distributed control plane supporting one (or more) failure\
   notification mechanism(s), regardless of the mechanism's actual\
   implementation, the same capabilities are needed with more (or less)\
   information provided about the LSPs/spans under failure condition,\
   their detailed statuses, etc.\
\
   The most important difference between these mechanisms is related to\
   the fact that transport plane notifications (as defined today) would\
   directly initiate either a certain type of protection switching (such\
   as those described in [RFC4427]) via the transport plane or\
   restoration actions via the management plane.\
\
   On the other hand, using a failure notification mechanism through the\
   control plane would provide the possibility of triggering either a\
   protection or a restoration action via the control plane.  This has\
   the advantage that a control-plane-recovery-responsible entity does\
   not necessarily have to be co-located with a transport\
   maintenance/recovery domain.  A control plane recovery domain can be\
   defined at entities not supporting a transport plane recovery.\
\
   Moreover, as specified in [RFC3473], notification message exchanges\
   through a GMPLS control plane may not follow the same path as the\
   LSP/spans for which these messages carry the status.  In turn, this\
   ensures a fast, reliable (through acknowledgement and the use of\

\
\
   either a dedicated control plane network or disjoint control\
   channels), and efficient (through the aggregation of several LSP/span\
   statuses within the same message) failure notification mechanism.\
\
   The other important properties to be met by the failure notification\
   mechanism are mainly the following:\
\
   - Notification messages must provide enough information such that the\
     most efficient subsequent recovery action will be taken at the\
     recovering entities (in most of the recovery types and schemes this\
     action is even deterministic).  Remember here that these entities\
     can be either intermediate or end-points through which normal\
     traffic flows.  Based on local policy, intermediate nodes may not\
     use this information for subsequent recovery actions (see for\
     instance the APS protocol phases as described in [RFC4427]).  In\
     addition, since fast notification is a mechanism running in\
     collaboration with the existing GMPLS signaling (see [RFC3473])\
     that also allows intermediate nodes to stay informed about the\
     status of the working LSP/spans under failure condition.\
\
     The trade-off here arises when defining what information the\
     LSP/span end-points (more precisely, the deciding entities) need in\
     order for the recovering entity to take the best recovery action:\
     If not enough information is provided, the decision cannot be\
     optimal (note that in this eventuality, the important issue is to\
     quantify the level of sub-optimality).  If too much information is\
     provided, the control plane may be overloaded with unnecessary\
     information and the aggregation/correlation of this notification\
     information will be more complex and time-consuming to achieve.\
     Note that a more detailed quantification of the amount of\
     information to be exchanged and processed is strongly dependent on\
     the failure notification protocol.\
\
   - If the failure localization and isolation are not performed by one\
     of the LSP/span end-points or some intermediate points, the points\
     should receive enough information from the notification message in\
     order to locate the failure.  Otherwise, they would need to (re-)\
     initiate a failure localization and isolation action.\
\
   - Avoiding so-called notification storms implies that 1) the failure\
     detection output is correlated (i.e., alarm correlation) and\
     aggregated at the node detecting the failure(s), 2) the failure\
     notifications are directed to a restricted set of destinations (in\
     general the end-points), and 3) failure notification suppression\
     (i.e., alarm suppression) is provided in order to limit flooding in\
     case of multiple and/or correlated failures detected at several\
     locations in the network.\

\
\
   - Alarm correlation and aggregation (at the failure-detecting node)\
     implies a consistent decision based on the conditions for which a\
     trade-off between fast convergence (at detecting node) and fast\
     notification (implying that correlation and aggregation occurs at\
     receiving end-points) can be found.\
\
4.4.  Failure Correlation\
\
   A single failure event (such as a span failure) can cause multiple\
   failure (such as individual LSP failures) conditions to be reported.\
   These can be grouped (i.e., correlated) to reduce the number of\
   failure conditions communicated on the reporting channel, for both\
   in-band and out-of-band failure reporting.\
\
   In such a scenario, it can be important to wait for a certain period\
   of time, typically called failure correlation time, and gather all\
   the failures to report them as a group of failures (or simply group\
   failure).  For instance, this approach can be provided using LMP-WDM\
   for pre-OTN networks (see [RFC4209]) or when using Signal\
   Failure/Degrade Group in the SONET/SDH context.\
\
   Note that a default average time interval during which failure\
   correlation operation can be performed is difficult to provide since\
   it is strongly dependent on the underlying network topology.\
   Therefore, providing a per-node configurable failure correlation time\
   can be advisable.  The detailed selection criteria for this time\
   interval are outside of the scope of this document.\
\
   When failure correlation is not provided, multiple failure\
   notification messages may be sent out in response to a single failure\
   (for instance, a fiber cut).  Each failure notification message\
   contains a set of information on the failed working resources (for\
   instance, the individual lambda LSP flowing through this fiber).\
   This allows for a more prompt response, but can potentially overload\
   the control plane due to a large amount of failure notifications.\
\
5.  Recovery Mechanisms\
\
5.1.  Transport vs. Control Plane Responsibilities\
\
   When applicable, recovery resources are provisioned, for both\
   protection and restoration, using GMPLS signaling capabilities.\
   Thus, these are control plane-driven actions (topological and\
   resource-constrained) that are always performed in this context.\
\
   The following tables give an overview of the responsibilities taken\
   by the control plane in case of LSP/span recovery:\

\
   1. LSP/span Protection\
\
   - Phase 1: Failure Detection                  Transport plane\
   - Phase 2: Failure Localization/Isolation     Transport/Control plane\
   - Phase 3: Failure Notification               Transport/Control plane\
   - Phase 4: Protection Switching               Transport/Control plane\
   - Phase 5: Reversion (Normalization)          Transport/Control plane\
\
   Note: in the context of LSP/span protection, control plane actions\
   can be performed either for operational purposes and/or\
   synchronization purposes (vertical synchronization between transport\
   and control plane) and/or notification purposes (horizontal\
   synchronization between end-nodes at control plane level).  This\
   suggests the selection of the responsible plane (in particular for\
   protection switching) during the provisioning phase of the\
   protected/protection LSP.\
\
   2. LSP/span Restoration\
\
   - Phase 1: Failure Detection                  Transport plane\
   - Phase 2: Failure Localization/Isolation     Transport/Control plane\
   - Phase 3: Failure Notification               Control plane\
   - Phase 4: Recovery Switching                 Control plane\
   - Phase 5: Reversion (Normalization)          Control plane\
\
   Therefore, this document primarily focuses on provisioning of LSP\
   recovery resources, failure notification mechanisms, recovery\
   switching, and reversion operations.  Moreover, some additional\
   considerations can be dedicated to the mechanisms associated to the\
   failure localization/isolation phase.\
\
5.2.  Technology-Independent and Technology-Dependent Mechanisms\
\
   The present recovery mechanisms analysis applies to any circuit-\
   oriented data plane technology with discrete bandwidth increments\
   (like SONET/SDH, G.709 OTN, etc.) being controlled by a GMPLS-based\
   distributed control plane.\
\
   The following sub-sections are not intended to favor one technology\
   versus another.  They list pro and cons for each technology in order\
   to determine the mechanisms that GMPLS-based recovery must deliver to\
   overcome their cons and make use of their pros in their respective\
   applicability context.\
\
5.2.1.  OTN Recovery\
\
   OTN recovery specifics are left for further consideration.\
\
\
\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
5.2.2.  Pre-OTN Recovery\
\
   Pre-OTN recovery specifics (also referred to as "lambda switching")\
   present mainly the following advantages:\
\
   - They benefit from a simpler architecture, making it more suitable\
     for mesh-based recovery types and schemes (on a per-channel basis).\
\
   - Failure suppression at intermediate node transponders, e.g., use of\
     squelching, implies that failures (such as LoL) will propagate to\
     edge nodes.  Thus, edge nodes will have the possibility to initiate\
     recovery actions driven by upper layers (vs. use of non-standard\
     masking of upstream failures).\
\
   The main disadvantage is the lack of interworking due to the large\
   amount of failure management (in particular failure notification\
   protocols) and recovery mechanisms currently available.\
\
   Note also, that for all-optical networks, combination of recovery\
   with optical physical impairments is left for a future release of\
   this document because corresponding detection technologies are under\
   specification.\
\
5.2.3.  SONET/SDH Recovery\
\
   Some of the advantages of SONET [T1.105]/SDH [G.707], and more\
   generically any Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) transport plane\
   recovery, are that they provide:\
\
   - Protection types operating at the data plane level that are\
     standardized (see [G.841]) and can operate across protected domains\
     and interwork (see [G.842]).\
\
   - Failure detection, notification, and path/section Automatic\
     Protection Switching (APS) mechanisms.\
\
   - Greater control over the granularity of the TDM LSPs/links that can\
     be recovered with respect to coarser optical channel (or whole\
     fiber content) recovery switching\
\
   Some of the limitations of the SONET/SDH recovery are:\
\
   - Limited topological scope: Inherently the use of ring topologies,\
     typically, dedicated Sub-Network Connection Protection (SNCP) or\
     shared protection rings, has reduced flexibility and resource\
     efficiency with respect to the (somewhat more complex) meshed\
     recovery.\

\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   - Inefficient use of spare capacity: SONET/SDH protection is largely\
     applied to ring topologies, where spare capacity often remains\
     idle, making the efficiency of bandwidth usage a real issue.\
\
   - Support of meshed recovery requires intensive network management\
     development, and the functionality is limited by both the network\
     elements and the capabilities of the element management systems\
     (thus justifying the development of GMPLS-based distributed\
     recovery mechanisms.)\
\
5.3.  Specific Aspects of Control Plane-Based Recovery Mechanisms\
\
5.3.1.  In-Band vs. Out-Of-Band Signaling\
\
   The nodes communicate through the use of IP terminating control\
   channels defining the control plane (transport) topology.  In this\
   context, two classes of transport mechanisms can be considered here:\
   in-fiber or out-of-fiber (through a dedicated physically diverse\
   control network referred to as the Data Communication Network or\
   DCN).  The potential impact of the usage of an in-fiber (signaling)\
   transport mechanism is briefly considered here.\
\
   In-fiber transport mechanisms can be further subdivided into in-band\
   and out-of-band.  As such, the distinction between in-fiber in-band\
   and in-fiber out-of-band signaling reduces to the consideration of a\
   logically- versus physically-embedded control plane topology with\
   respect to the transport plane topology.  In the scope of this\
   document, it is assumed that at least one IP control channel between\
   each pair of adjacent nodes is continuously available to enable the\
   exchange of recovery-related information and messages.  Thus, in\
   either case (i.e., in-band or out-of-band) at least one logical or\
   physical control channel between each pair of nodes is always\
   expected to be available.\
\
   Therefore, the key issue when using in-fiber signaling is whether one\
   can assume independence between the fault-tolerance capabilities of\
   control plane and the failures affecting the transport plane\
   (including the nodes).  Note also that existing specifications like\
   the OTN provide a limited form of independence for in-fiber signaling\
   by dedicating a separate optical supervisory channel (OSC, see\
   [G.709] and [G.874]) to transport the overhead and other control\
   traffic.  For OTNs, failure of the OSC does not result in failing the\
   optical channels.  Similarly, loss of the control channel must not\
   result in failing the data channels (transport plane).\

5.3.2.  Uni- vs. Bi-Directional Failures\
\
   The failure detection, correlation, and notification mechanisms\
   (described in Section 4) can be triggered when either a uni-\
   directional or a bi-directional LSP/Span failure occurs (or a\
   combination of both).  As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, two\
   alternatives can be considered here:\
\
   1. Uni-directional failure detection: the failure is detected on the\
      receiver side, i.e., it is detected by only the downstream node to\
      the failure (or by the upstream node depending on the failure\
      propagation direction, respectively).\
\
   2. Bi-directional failure detection: the failure is detected on the\
      receiver side of both downstream node AND upstream node to the\
      failure.\
\
   Notice that after the failure detection time, if only control-plane-\
   based failure management is provided, the peering node is unaware of\
   the failure detection status of its neighbor.\

\
               Figure 2: Bi-directional failure detection\
\
   After failure detection, the following failure management operations\
   can be subsequently considered:\
\
   - Each detecting entity sends a notification message to the\
     corresponding transmitting entity.  For instance, in Figure 1, node\
     C sends a notification message to node B.  In Figure 2, node C\
     sends a notification message to node B while node B sends a\
     notification message to node C.  To ensure reliable failure\
     notification, a dedicated acknowledgement message can be returned\
     back to the sender node.\
\
   - Next, within a certain (and pre-determined) time window, nodes\
     impacted by the failure occurrences may perform their correlation.\
     In case of uni-directional failure, node B only receives the\
     notification message from node C, and thus the time for this\
     operation is negligible.  In case of bi-directional failure, node B\
     has to correlate the received notification message from node C with\
     the corresponding locally detected information (and node C has to\
     do the same with the message from node B).\
\
   - After some (pre-determined) period of time, referred to as the\
     hold-off time, if the local recovery actions (see Section 5.3.4)\
     were not successful, the following occurs.  In case of uni-\
     directional failure and depending on the directionality of the LSP,\
     node B should send an upstream notification message (see [RFC3473])\
     to the ingress node A.  Node C may send a downstream notification\
     message (see [RFC3473]) to the egress node D.  However, in that\
     case, only node A would initiate an edge to edge recovery action.\
     Node A is referred to as the "master", and node D is referred to as\
     the "slave", per [RFC4427].  Note that the other LSP end-node (node\
     D in this case) may be optionally notified using a downstream\
     notification message (see [RFC3473]).\

\
\
     In case of bi-directional failure, node B should send an upstream\
     notification message (see [RFC3473]) to the ingress node A.  Node C\
     may send a downstream notification message (see [RFC3473]) to the\
     egress node D.  However, due to the dependence on the LSP\
     directionality, only ingress node A would initiate an edge-to-edge\
     recovery action.  Note that the other LSP end-node (node D in this\
     case) should also be notified of this event using a downstream\
     notification message (see [RFC3473]).  For instance, if an LSP\
     directed from D to A is under failure condition, only the\
     notification message sent from node C to D would initiate a\
     recovery action.  In this case, per [RFC4427], the deciding and\
     recovering node D is referred to as the "master", while node A is\
     referred to as the "slave" (i.e., recovering only entity).\
\
     Note: The determination of the master and the slave may be based\
     either on configured information or dedicated protocol capability.\
\
   In the above scenarios, the path followed by the upstream and\
   downstream notification messages does not have to be the same as the\
   one followed by the failed LSP (see [RFC3473] for more details on the\
   notification message exchange).  The important point concerning this\
   mechanism is that either the detecting/reporting entity (i.e., nodes\
   B and C) is also the deciding/recovery entity or the\
   detecting/reporting entity is simply an intermediate node in the\
   subsequent recovery process.  One refers to local recovery in the\
   former case, and to edge-to-edge recovery in the latter one (see also\
   Section 5.3.4).\
\
5.3.3.  Partial vs. Full Span Recovery\
\
   When a given span carries more than one LSP or LSP segment, an\
   additional aspect must be considered.  In case of span failure, the\
   LSPs it carries can be recovered individually, as a group (aka bulk\
   LSP recovery), or as independent sub-groups.  When correlation time\
   windows are used and simultaneous recovery of several LSPs can be\
   performed using a single request, the selection of this mechanism\
   would be triggered independently of the failure notification\
   granularity.  Moreover, criteria for forming such sub-groups are\
   outside of the scope of this document.\
\
   Additional complexity arises in the case of (sub-)group LSP recovery.\
   Between a given pair of nodes, the LSPs that a given (sub-)group\
   contains may have been created from different source nodes (i.e.,\
   initiator) and directed toward different destination nodes.\
   Consequently the failure notification messages following a bi-\
   directional span failure that affects several LSPs (or the whole\
   group of LSPs it carries) are not necessarily directed toward the\
   same initiator nodes.  In particular, these messages may be directed\
\

\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   to both the upstream and downstream nodes to the failure.  Therefore,\
   such span failure may trigger recovery actions to be performed from\
   both sides (i.e., from both the upstream and the downstream nodes to\
   the failure).  In order to facilitate the definition of the\
   corresponding recovery mechanisms (and their sequence), one assumes\
   here as well that, per [RFC4427], the deciding (and recovering)\
   entity (referred to as the "master") is the only initiator of the\
   recovery of the whole LSP (sub-)group.\
\
5.3.4.  Difference between LSP, LSP Segment and Span Recovery\
\
   The recovery definitions given in [RFC4427] are quite generic and\
   apply for link (or local span) and LSP recovery.  The major\
   difference between LSP, LSP Segment and span recovery is related to\
   the number of intermediate nodes that the signaling messages have to\
   travel.  Since nodes are not necessarily adjacent in the case of LSP\
   (or LSP Segment) recovery, signaling message exchanges from the\
   reporting to the deciding/recovery entity may have to cross several\
   intermediate nodes.  In particular, this applies to the notification\
   messages due to the number of hops separating the location of a\
   failure occurrence from its destination.  This results in an\
   additional propagation and forwarding delay.  Note that the former\
   delay may in certain circumstances be non-negligible; e.g., in a\
   copper out-of-band network, the delay is approximately 1 ms per\
   200km.\
\
   Moreover, the recovery mechanisms applicable to end-to-end LSPs and\
   to the segments that may compose an end-to-end LSP (i.e., edge-to-\
   edge recovery) can be exactly the same.  However, one expects in the\
   latter case, that the destination of the failure notification message\
   will be the ingress/egress of each of these segments.  Therefore,\
   using the mechanisms described in Section 5.3.2, failure notification\
   messages can be exchanged first between terminating points of the LSP\
   segment, and after expiration of the hold-off time, between\
   terminating points of the end-to-end LSP.\
\
   Note: Several studies provide quantitative analysis of the relative\
   performance of LSP/span recovery techniques. [WANG] for instance,\
   provides an analysis grid for these techniques showing that dynamic\
   LSP restoration (see Section 5.5.2) performs well under medium\
   network loads, but suffers performance degradations at higher loads\
   due to greater contention for recovery resources.  LSP restoration\
   upon span failure, as defined in [WANG], degrades at higher loads\
   because paths around failed links tend to increase the hop count of\
   the affected LSPs and thus consume additional network resources.\
   Also, performance of LSP restoration can be enhanced by a failed\
   working LSP's source node that initiates a new recovery attempt if an\
   initial attempt fails.  A single retry attempt is sufficient to\

\
\
   produce large increases in the restoration success rate and ability\
   to initiate successful LSP restoration attempts, especially at high\
   loads, while not adding significantly to the long-term average\
   recovery time.  Allowing additional attempts produces only small\
   additional gains in performance.  This suggests using additional\
   (intermediate) crankback signaling when using dynamic LSP restoration\
   (described in Section 5.5.2 - case 2).  Details on crankback\
   signaling are outside the scope of this document.\
\
5.4.  Difference between Recovery Type and Scheme\
\
   [RFC4427] defines the basic LSP/span recovery types.  This section\
   describes the recovery schemes that can be built using these recovery\
   types.  In brief, a recovery scheme is defined as the combination of\
   several ingress-egress node pairs supporting a given recovery type\
   (from the set of the recovery types they allow).  Several examples\
   are provided here to illustrate the difference between recovery types\
   such as 1:1 or M:N, and recovery schemes such as (1:1)^n or (M:N)^n\
   (referred to as shared-mesh recovery).\
\
   1. (1:1)^n with recovery resource sharing\
\
   The exponent, n, indicates the number of times a 1:1 recovery type is\
   applied between at most n different ingress-egress node pairs.  Here,\
   at most n pairs of disjoint working and recovery LSPs/spans share a\
   common resource at most n times.  Since the working LSPs/spans are\
   mutually disjoint, simultaneous requests for use of the shared\
   (common) resource will only occur in case of simultaneous failures,\
   which are less likely to happen.\
\
   For instance, in the common (1:1)^2 case, if the 2 recovery LSPs in\
   the group overlap the same common resource, then it can handle only\
   single failures; any multiple working LSP failures will cause at\
   least one working LSP to be denied automatic recovery.  Consider for\
   instance the following topology with the working LSPs A-B-C and F-G-H\
   and their respective recovery LSPs A-D-E-C and F-D-E-H that share a\
   common D-E link resource.\
\
                          A---------B---------C\
                           \\                 /\
                            \\               /\
                             D-------------E\
                            /               \\\
                           /                 \\\
                          F---------G---------H\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   2. (M:N)^n with recovery resource sharing\
\
   The (M:N)^n scheme is documented here for the sake of completeness\
   only (i.e., it is not mandated that GMPLS capabilities support this\
   scheme).  The exponent, n, indicates the number of times an M:N\
   recovery type is applied between at most n different ingress-egress\
   node pairs.  So the interpretation follows from the previous case,\
   except that here disjointness applies to the N working LSPs/spans and\
   to the M recovery LSPs/spans while sharing at most n times M common\
   resources.\
\
   In both schemes, it results in a "group" of sum{n=1}^N N{n} working\
   LSPs and a pool of shared recovery resources, not all of which are\
   available to any given working LSP.  In such conditions, defining a\
   metric that describes the amount of overlap among the recovery LSPs\
   would give some indication of the group's ability to handle\
   simultaneous failures of multiple LSPs.\
\
   For instance, in the simple (1:1)^n case, if n recovery LSPs in a\
   (1:1)^n group overlap, then the group can handle only single\
   failures; any simultaneous failure of multiple working LSPs will\
   cause at least one working LSP to be denied automatic recovery.  But\
   if one considers, for instance, a (2:2)^2 group in which there are\
   two pairs of overlapping recovery LSPs, then two LSPs (belonging to\
   the same pair) can be simultaneously recovered.  The latter case can\
   be illustrated by the following topology with 2 pairs of working LSPs\
   A-B-C and F-G-H and their respective recovery LSPs A-D-E-C and\
   F-D-E-H that share two common D-E link resources.\
\
                           A========B========C\
                           \\\\               //\
                            \\\\             //\
                             D =========== E\
                            //             \\\\\
                           //               \\\\\
                           F========G========H\
\
   Moreover, in all these schemes, (working) path disjointness can be\
   enforced by exchanging information related to working LSPs during the\
   recovery LSP signaling.  Specific issues related to the combination\
   of shared (discrete) bandwidth and disjointness for recovery schemes\
   are described in Section 8.4.2.\

\
\
5.5.  LSP Recovery Mechanisms\
\
5.5.1.  Classification\
\
   The recovery time and ratio of LSPs/spans depend on proper recovery\
   LSP provisioning (meaning pre-provisioning when performed before\
   failure occurrence) and the level of overbooking of recovery\
   resources (i.e., over-provisioning).  A proper balance of these two\
   operations will result in the desired LSP/span recovery time and\
   ratio when single or multiple failures occur.  Note also that these\
   operations are mostly performed during the network planning phases.\
\
   The different options for LSP (pre-)provisioning and overbooking are\
   classified below to structure the analysis of the different recovery\
   mechanisms.\
\
   1. Pre-Provisioning\
\
   Proper recovery LSP pre-provisioning will help to alleviate the\
   failure of the working LSPs (due to the failure of the resources that\
   carry these LSPs).  As an example, one may compute and establish the\
   recovery LSP either end-to-end or segment-per-segment, to protect a\
   working LSP from multiple failure events affecting link(s), node(s)\
   and/or SRLG(s).  The recovery LSP pre-provisioning options are\
   classified as follows in the figure below:\
\
   (1) The recovery path can be either pre-computed or computed on-\
       demand.\
\
   (2) When the recovery path is pre-computed, it can be either pre-\
       signaled (implying recovery resource reservation) or signaled\
       on-demand.\
\
   (3) When the recovery resources are pre-signaled, they can be either\
       pre-selected or selected on-demand.\

                                                 --> Pre-Selected\
\
   Note that these different options lead to different LSP/span recovery\
   times.  The following sections will consider the above-mentioned\
   pre-provisioning options when analyzing the different recovery\
   mechanisms.\
\
   2. Overbooking\
\
   There are many mechanisms available that allow the overbooking of the\
   recovery resources.  This overbooking can be done per LSP (as in the\
   example mentioned above), per link (such as span protection), or even\
   per domain.  In all these cases, the level of overbooking, as shown\
   in the below figure, can be classified as dedicated (such as 1+1 and\
   1:1), shared (such as 1:N and M:N), or unprotected (and thus\
   restorable, if enough recovery resources are available).\
\
   Overbooking levels:\
\
                    +----- Dedicated (for instance: 1+1, 1:1, etc.)\
                    |\
                    |\
\
                    +----- Shared (for instance: 1:N, M:N, etc.)\
                    |\
   Level of         |\
   Overbooking -----+----- Unprotected (for instance: 0:1, 0:N)\
\
   Also, when using shared recovery, one may support preemptible extra-\
   traffic; the recovery mechanism is then expected to allow preemption\
   of this low priority traffic in case of recovery resource contention\
   during recovery operations.  The following sections will consider the\

\
\
   above-mentioned overbooking options when analyzing the different\
   recovery mechanisms.\
\
5.5.2.  LSP Restoration\
\
   The following times are defined to provide a quantitative estimation\
   about the time performance of the different LSP restoration\
   mechanisms (also referred to as LSP re-routing):\
\
   - Path Computation Time: Tc\
   - Path Selection Time: Ts\
   - End-to-end LSP Resource Reservation Time: Tr (a delta for resource\
     selection is also considered, the corresponding total time is then\
     referred to as Trs)\
   - End-to-end LSP Resource Activation Time: Ta (a delta for\
     resource selection is also considered, the corresponding total\
     time is then referred to as Tas)\
\
   The Path Selection Time (Ts) is considered when a pool of recovery\
   LSP paths between a given pair of source/destination end-points is\
   pre-computed, and after a failure occurrence one of these paths is\
   selected for the recovery of the LSP under failure condition.\
\
   Note: failure management operations such as failure detection,\
   correlation, and notification are considered (for a given failure\
   event) as equally time-consuming for all the mechanisms described\
   below:\
\
   1. With Route Pre-computation (or LSP re-provisioning)\
\
   An end-to-end restoration LSP is established after the failure(s)\
   occur(s) based on a pre-computed path.  As such, one can define this\
   as an "LSP re-provisioning" mechanism.  Here, one or more (disjoint)\
   paths for the restoration LSP are computed (and optionally pre-\
   selected) before a failure occurs.\
\
   No reservation or selection of resources is performed along the\
   restoration path before failure occurrence.  As a result, there is no\
   guarantee that a restoration LSP is available when a failure occurs.\

   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Ts + Trs or to\
   Trs when a dedicated computation is performed for each working LSP.\

   An end-to-end restoration LSP is dynamically established after the\
   failure(s) occur(s).  After failure occurrence, one or more\
   (disjoint) paths for the restoration LSP are dynamically computed and\

\
\
   one is selected.  As such, one can define this as a complete "LSP\
   re-routing" mechanism.\
\
   No reservation or selection of resources is performed along the\
   restoration path before failure occurrence.  As a result, there is no\
   guarantee that a restoration LSP is available when a failure occurs.\
\
   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Tc (+ Ts) +\
   Trs.  Therefore, time performance between these two approaches\
   differs by the time required for route computation Tc (and its\
   potential selection time, Ts).\
\
5.5.3.  Pre-Planned LSP Restoration\
\
   Pre-planned LSP restoration (also referred to as pre-planned LSP re-\
   routing) implies that the restoration LSP is pre-signaled.  This in\
   turn implies the reservation of recovery resources along the\
   restoration path.  Two cases can be defined based on whether the\
   recovery resources are pre-selected.\
\
   1. With resource reservation and without resource pre-selection\
\
   Before failure occurrence, an end-to-end restoration path is pre-\
   selected from a set of pre-computed (disjoint) paths.  The\
   restoration LSP is signaled along this pre-selected path to reserve\
   resources at each node, but these resources are not selected.\
\
   In this case, the resources reserved for each restoration LSP may be\
   dedicated or shared between multiple restoration LSPs whose working\
   LSPs are not expected to fail simultaneously.  Local node policies\
   can be applied to define the degree to which these resources can be\
   shared across independent failures.  Also, since a restoration scheme\
   is considered, resource sharing should not be limited to restoration\
   LSPs that start and end at the same ingress and egress nodes.\
   Therefore, each node participating in this scheme is expected to\
   receive some feedback information on the sharing degree of the\
   recovery resource(s) that this scheme involves.\
\
   Upon failure detection/notification message reception, signaling is\
   initiated along the restoration path to select the resources, and to\
   perform the appropriate operation at each node crossed by the\
   restoration LSP (e.g., cross-connections).  If lower priority LSPs\
   were established using the restoration resources, they must be\
   preempted when the restoration LSP is activated.\
\
   Thus, the expected total restoration time T is equal to Tas (post-\
   failure activation), while operations performed before failure\
   occurrence take Tc + Ts + Tr.\
\

\
\
   2. With both resource reservation and resource pre-selection\
\
   Before failure occurrence, an end-to-end restoration path is pre-\
   selected from a set of pre-computed (disjoint) paths.  The\
   restoration LSP is signaled along this pre-selected path to reserve\
   AND select resources at each node, but these resources are not\
   committed at the data plane level.  So that the selection of the\
   recovery resources is committed at the control plane level only, no\
   cross-connections are performed along the restoration path.\
\
   In this case, the resources reserved and selected for each\
   restoration LSP may be dedicated or even shared between multiple\
   restoration LSPs whose associated working LSPs are not expected to\
   fail simultaneously.  Local node policies can be applied to define\
   the degree to which these resources can be shared across independent\
   failures.  Also, because a restoration scheme is considered, resource\
   sharing should not be limited to restoration LSPs that start and end\
   at the same ingress and egress nodes.  Therefore, each node\
   participating in this scheme is expected to receive some feedback\
   information on the sharing degree of the recovery resource(s) that\
   this scheme involves.\
\
   Upon failure detection/notification message reception, signaling is\
   initiated along the restoration path to activate the reserved and\
   selected resources, and to perform the appropriate operation at each\
   node crossed by the restoration LSP (e.g., cross-connections).  If\
   lower priority LSPs were established using the restoration resources,\
   they must be preempted when the restoration LSP is activated.\
\
   Thus, the expected total restoration time T is equal to Ta (post-\
   failure activation), while operations performed before failure\
   occurrence take Tc + Ts + Trs.  Therefore, time performance between\
   these two approaches differs only by the time required for resource\
   selection during the activation of the recovery LSP (i.e., Tas - Ta).\
\
5.5.4.  LSP Segment Restoration\
\
   The above approaches can be applied on an edge-to-edge LSP basis\
   rather than end-to-end LSP basis (i.e., to reduce the global recovery\
   time) by allowing the recovery of the individual LSP segments\
   constituting the end-to-end LSP.\
\
   Also, by using the horizontal hierarchy approach described in Section\
   7.1, an end-to-end LSP can be recovered by multiple recovery\
   mechanisms applied on an LSP segment basis (e.g., 1:1 edge-to-edge\
   LSP protection in a metro network, and M:N edge-to-edge protection in\
   the core).  These mechanisms are ideally independent and may even use\
   different failure localization and notification mechanisms.\

\
\
6.  Reversion\
\
   Reversion (a.k.a. normalization) is defined as the mechanism allowing\
   switching of normal traffic from the recovery LSP/span to the working\
   LSP/span previously under failure condition.  Use of normalization is\
   at the discretion of the recovery domain policy.  Normalization may\
   impact the normal traffic (a second hit) depending on the\
   normalization mechanism used.\
\
   If normalization is supported, then 1) the LSP/span must be returned\
   to the working LSP/span when the failure condition clears and 2) the\
   capability to de-activate (turn-off) the use of reversion should be\
   provided.  De-activation of reversion should not impact the normal\
   traffic, regardless of whether it is currently using the working or\
   recovery LSP/span.\
\
   Note: during the failure, the reuse of any non-failed resources\
   (e.g., LSP and/or spans) belonging to the working LSP/span is under\
   the discretion of recovery domain policy.\
\
6.1.  Wait-To-Restore (WTR)\
\
   A specific mechanism (Wait-To-Restore) is used to prevent frequent\
   recovery switching operations due to an intermittent defect (e.g.,\
   Bit Error Rate (BER) fluctuating around the SD threshold).\
\
   First, an LSP/span under failure condition must become fault-free,\
   e.g., a BER less than a certain recovery threshold.  After the\
   recovered LSP/span (i.e., the previously working LSP/span) meets this\
   criterion, a fixed period of time shall elapse before normal traffic\
   uses the corresponding resources again.  This duration called Wait-\
   To-Restore (WTR) period or timer is generally on the order of a few\
   minutes (for instance, 5 minutes) and should be capable of being set.\
   The WTR timer may be either a fixed period, or provide for\
   incrementally longer periods before retrying.  An SF or SD condition\
   on the previously working LSP/span will override the WTR timer value\
   (i.e., the WTR cancels and the WTR timer will restart).\
\
6.2.  Revertive Mode Operation\
\
   In revertive mode of operation, when the recovery LSP/span is no\
   longer required, i.e., the failed working LSP/span is no longer in SD\
   or SF condition, a local Wait-to-Restore (WTR) state will be\
   activated before switching the normal traffic back to the recovered\
   working LSP/span.\
\
   During the reversion operation, since this state becomes the highest\
   in priority, signaling must maintain the normal traffic on the\
\
\

\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   recovery LSP/span from the previously failed working LSP/span.\
   Moreover, during this WTR state, any null traffic or extra traffic\
   (if applicable) request is rejected.\
\
   However, deactivation (cancellation) of the wait-to-restore timer may\
   occur if there are higher priority request attempts.  That is, the\
   recovery LSP/span usage by the normal traffic may be preempted if a\
   higher priority request for this recovery LSP/span is attempted.\
\
6.3.  Orphans\
\
   When a reversion operation is requested, normal traffic must be\
   switched from the recovery to the recovered working LSP/span.  A\
   particular situation occurs when the previously working LSP/span\
   cannot be recovered, so normal traffic cannot be switched back.  In\
   that case, the LSP/span under failure condition (also referred to as\
   "orphan") must be cleared (i.e., removed) from the pool of resources\
   allocated for normal traffic.  Otherwise, potential de-\
   synchronization between the control and transport plane resource\
   usage can appear.  Depending on the signaling protocol capabilities\
   and behavior, different mechanisms are expected here.\
\
   Therefore, any reserved or allocated resources for the LSP/span under\
   failure condition must be unreserved/de-allocated.  Several ways can\
   be used for that purpose: wait for the clear-out time interval to\
   elapse, initiate a deletion from the ingress or the egress node, or\
   trigger the initiation of deletion from an entity (such as an EMS or\
   NMS) capable of reacting upon reception of an appropriate\
   notification message.\
\
7.  Hierarchies\
\
   Recovery mechanisms are being made available at multiple (if not all)\
   transport layers within so-called "IP/MPLS-over-optical" networks.\
   However, each layer has certain recovery features, and one needs to\
   determine the exact impact of the interaction between the recovery\
   mechanisms provided by these layers.\
\
   Hierarchies are used to build scalable complex systems.  By hiding\
   the internal details, abstraction is used as a mechanism to build\
   large networks or as a technique for enforcing technology,\
   topological, or administrative boundaries.  The same hierarchical\
   concept can be applied to control the network survivability.  Network\
   survivability is the set of capabilities that allow a network to\
   restore affected traffic in the event of a failure.  Network\
   survivability is defined further in [RFC4427].  In general, it is\
   expected that the recovery action is taken by the recoverable\
   LSP/span closest to the failure in order to avoid the multiplication\
\
\
\
Papadimitriou & Mannie       Informational                     [Page 27]\
\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   of recovery actions.  Moreover, recovery hierarchies also can be\
   bound to control plane logical partitions (e.g., administrative or\
   topological boundaries).  Each logical partition may apply different\
   recovery mechanisms.\
\
   In brief, it is commonly accepted that the lower layers can provide\
   coarse but faster recovery while the higher layers can provide finer\
   but slower recovery.  Moreover, it is also desirable to avoid similar\
   layers with functional overlaps in order to optimize network resource\
   utilization and processing overhead, since repeating the same\
   capabilities at each layer does not create any added value for the\
   network as a whole.  In addition, even if a lower layer recovery\
   mechanism is enabled, it does not prevent the additional provision of\
   a recovery mechanism at the upper layer.  The inverse statement does\
   not necessarily hold; that is, enabling an upper layer recovery\
   mechanism may prevent the use of a lower layer recovery mechanism.\
   In this context, this section analyzes these hierarchical aspects\
   including the physical (passive) layer(s).\
\
7.1.  Horizontal Hierarchy (Partitioning)\
\
   A horizontal hierarchy is defined when partitioning a single-layer\
   network (and its control plane) into several recovery domains.\
   Within a domain, the recovery scope may extend over a link (or span),\
   LSP segment, or even an end-to-end LSP.  Moreover, an administrative\
   domain may consist of a single recovery domain or can be partitioned\
   into several smaller recovery domains.  The operator can partition\
   the network into recovery domains based on physical network topology,\
   control plane capabilities, or various traffic engineering\
   constraints.\
\
   An example often addressed in the literature is the metro-core-metro\
   application (sometimes extended to a metro-metro/core-core) within a\
   single transport layer (see Section 7.2).  For such a case, an end-\
   to-end LSP is defined between the ingress and egress metro nodes,\
   while LSP segments may be defined within the metro or core sub-\
   networks.  Each of these topological structures determines a so-\
   called "recovery domain" since each of the LSPs they carry can have\
   its own recovery type (or even scheme).  The support of multiple\
   recovery types and schemes within a sub-network is referred to as a\
   "multi-recovery capable domain" or simply "multi-recovery domain".\
\
7.2.  Vertical Hierarchy (Layers)\
\
   It is very challenging to combine the different recovery capabilities\
   available across the path (i.e., switching capable) and section\
   layers to ensure that certain network survivability objectives are\
   met for the network-supported services.\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   As a first analysis step, one can draw the following guidelines for\
   a vertical coordination of the recovery mechanisms:\
\
   - The lower the layer, the faster the notification and switching.\
\
   - The higher the layer, the finer the granularity of the recoverable\
     entity and therefore the granularity of the recovery resource.\
\
   Moreover, in the context of this analysis, a vertical hierarchy\
   consists of multiple layered transport planes providing different:\
\
   - Discrete bandwidth granularities for non-packet LSPs such as OCh,\
     ODUk, STS_SPE/HOVC, and VT_SPE/LOVC LSPs and continuous bandwidth\
     granularities for packet LSPs.\
\
   - Potential recovery capabilities with different temporal\
     granularities: ranging from milliseconds to tens of seconds\
\
   Note: based on the bandwidth granularity, we can determine four\
   classes of vertical hierarchies: (1) packet over packet, (2) packet\
   over circuit, (3) circuit over packet, and (4) circuit over circuit.\
   Below we briefly expand on (4) only. (2) is covered in [RFC3386]. (1)\
   is extensively covered by the MPLS Working Group, and (3) by the PWE3\
   Working Group.\
\
   In SONET/SDH environments, one typically considers the VT_SPE/LOVC\
   and STS SPE/HOVC as independent layers (for example, VT_SPE/LOVC LSP\
   uses the underlying STS_SPE/HOVC LSPs as links).  In OTN, the ODUk\
   path layers will lie on the OCh path layer, i.e., the ODUk LSPs use\
   the underlying OCh LSPs as OTUk links.  Note here that lower layer\
   LSPs may simply be provisioned and not necessarily dynamically\
   triggered or established (control driven approach).  In this context,\
   an LSP at the path layer (i.e., established using GMPLS signaling),\
   such as an optical channel LSP, appears at the OTUk layer as a link,\
   controlled by a link management protocol such as LMP.\
\
   The first key issue with multi-layer recovery is that achieving\
   individual or bulk LSP recovery will be as efficient as the\
   underlying link (local span) recovery.  In such a case, the span can\
   be either protected or unprotected, but the LSP it carries must be\
   (at least locally) recoverable.  Therefore, the span recovery process\
   can be either independent when protected (or restorable), or\
   triggered by the upper LSP recovery process.  The former case\
   requires coordination to achieve subsequent LSP recovery.  Therefore,\
   in order to achieve robustness and fast convergence, multi-layer\
   recovery requires a fine-tuned coordination mechanism.\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   Moreover, in the absence of adequate recovery mechanism coordination\
   (for instance, a pre-determined coordination when using a hold-off\
   timer), a failure notification may propagate from one layer to the\
   next one within a recovery hierarchy.  This can cause "collisions"\
   and trigger simultaneous recovery actions that may lead to race\
   conditions and, in turn, reduce the optimization of the resource\
   utilization and/or generate global instabilities in the network (see\
   [MANCHESTER]).  Therefore, a consistent and efficient escalation\
   strategy is needed to coordinate recovery across several layers.\
\
   One can expect that the definition of the recovery mechanisms and\
   protocol(s) is technology-independent so that they can be\
   consistently implemented at different layers; this would in turn\
   simplify their global coordination.  Moreover, as mentioned in\
   [RFC3386], some looser form of coordination and communication between\
   (vertical) layers such as a consistent hold-off timer configuration\
   (and setup through signaling during the working LSP establishment)\
   can be considered, thereby allowing the synchronization between\
   recovery actions performed across these layers.\
\
7.2.1.  Recovery Granularity\
\
   In most environments, the design of the network and the vertical\
   distribution of the LSP bandwidth are such that the recovery\
   granularity is finer at higher layers.  The OTN and SONET/SDH layers\
   can recover only the whole section or the individual connections they\
   transports whereas the IP/MPLS control plane can recover individual\
   packet LSPs or groups of packet LSPs independently of their\
   granularity.  On the other side, the recovery granularity at the\
   sub-wavelength level (i.e., SONET/SDH) can be provided only when the\
   network includes devices switching at the same granularity (and thus\
   not with optical channel level).  Therefore, the network layer can\
   deliver control-plane-driven recovery mechanisms on a per-LSP basis\
   if and only if these LSPs have their corresponding switching\
   granularity supported at the transport plane level.\
\
7.3.  Escalation Strategies\
\
   There are two types of escalation strategies (see [DEMEESTER]):\
   bottom-up and top-down.\
\
   The bottom-up approach assumes that lower layer recovery types and\
   schemes are more expedient and faster than upper layer ones.\
   Therefore, we can inhibit or hold off higher layer recovery.\
   However, this assumption is not entirely true.  Consider for instance\
   a SONET/SDH based protection mechanism (with a protection switching\
   time of less than 50 ms) lying on top of an OTN restoration mechanism\
   (with a restoration time of less than 200 ms).  Therefore, this\
\
\
\
Papadimitriou & Mannie       Informational                     [Page 30]\
\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   assumption should be (at least) clarified as: the lower layer\
   recovery mechanism is expected to be faster than the upper level one,\
   if the same type of recovery mechanism is used at each layer.\
\
   Consequently, taking into account the recovery actions at the\
   different layers in a bottom-up approach: if lower layer recovery\
   mechanisms are provided and sequentially activated in conjunction\
   with higher layer ones, the lower layers must have an opportunity to\
   recover normal traffic before the higher layers do.  However, if\
   lower layer recovery is slower than higher layer recovery, the lower\
   layer must either communicate the failure-related information to the\
   higher layer(s) (and allow it to perform recovery), or use a hold-off\
   timer in order to temporarily set the higher layer recovery action in\
   a "standby mode".  Note that the a priori information exchange\
   between layers concerning their efficiency is not within the current\
   scope of this document.  Nevertheless, the coordination functionality\
   between layers must be configurable and tunable.\
\
   For example, coordination between the optical and packet layer\
   control plane enables the optical layer to perform the failure\
   management operations (in particular, failure detection and\
   notification) while giving to the packet layer control plane the\
   authority to decide and perform the recovery actions.  If the packet\
   layer recovery action is unsuccessful, fallback at the optical layer\
   can be performed subsequently.\
\
   The top-down approach attempts service recovery at the higher layers\
   before invoking lower layer recovery.  Higher layer recovery is\
   service selective, and permits "per-CoS" or "per-connection" re-\
   routing.  With this approach, the most important aspect is that the\
   upper layer should provide its own reliable and independent failure\
   detection mechanism from the lower layer.\
\
   [DEMEESTER] also suggests recovery mechanisms incorporating a\
   coordinated effort shared by two adjacent layers with periodic status\
   updates.  Moreover, some of these recovery operations can be pre-\
   assigned (on a per-link basis) to a certain layer, e.g., a given link\
   will be recovered at the packet layer while another will be recovered\
   at the optical layer.\
\
7.4.  Disjointness\
\
   Having link and node diverse working and recovery LSPs/spans does not\
   guarantee their complete disjointness.  Due to the common physical\
   layer topology (passive), additional hierarchical concepts, such as\
   the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG), and mechanisms, such as SRLG\
   diverse path computation, must be developed to provide complete\
   working and recovery LSP/span disjointness (see [IPO-IMP] and\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   [RFC4202]).  Otherwise, a failure affecting the working LSP/span\
   would also potentially affect the recovery LSP/span; one refers to\
   such an event as "common failure".\
\
7.4.1.  SRLG Disjointness\
\
   A Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) is defined as the set of links\
   sharing a common risk (such as a common physical resource such as a\
   fiber link or a fiber cable).  For instance, a set of links L belongs\
   to the same SRLG s, if they are provisioned over the same fiber link\
   f.\
\
   The SRLG properties can be summarized as follows:\
\
   1) A link belongs to more than one SRLG if and only if it crosses one\
      of the resources covered by each of them.\
\
   2) Two links belonging to the same SRLG can belong individually to\
      (one or more) other SRLGs.\
\
   3) The SRLG set S of an LSP is defined as the union of the individual\
      SRLG s of the individual links composing this LSP.\
\
   SRLG disjointness is also applicable to LSPs:\
\
      The LSP SRLG disjointness concept is based on the following\
      postulate: an LSP (i.e., a sequence of links and nodes) covers an\
      SRLG if and only if it crosses one of the links or nodes belonging\
      to that SRLG.\
\
      Therefore, the SRLG disjointness for LSPs, can be defined as\
      follows: two LSPs are disjoint with respect to an SRLG s if and\
      only if they do not cover simultaneously this SRLG s.\
\
      Whilst the SRLG disjointness for LSPs with respect to a set S of\
      SRLGs, is defined as follows: two LSPs are disjoint with respect\
      to a set of SRLGs S if and only if the set of SRLGs that are\
      common to both LSPs is disjoint from set S.\
\
   The impact on recovery is noticeable: SRLG disjointness is a\
   necessary (but not a sufficient) condition to ensure network\
   survivability.  With respect to the physical network resources, a\
   working-recovery LSP/span pair must be SRLG-disjoint in case of\
   dedicated recovery type.  On the other hand, in case of shared\
   recovery, a group of working LSP/spans must be mutually SRLG-disjoint\
   in order to allow for a (single and common) shared recovery LSP that\
   is itself SRLG-disjoint from each of the working LSPs/spans.\

8.  Recovery Mechanisms Analysis\
\
   In order to provide a structured analysis of the recovery mechanisms\
   detailed in the previous sections, the following dimensions can be\
   considered:\
\
   1. Fast convergence (performance): provide a mechanism that\
      aggregates multiple failures (implying fast failure detection and\
      correlation mechanisms) and fast recovery decision independently\
      of the number of failures occurring in the optical network (also\
      implying a fast failure notification).\
\
   2. Efficiency (scalability): minimize the switching time required for\
      LSP/span recovery independently of the number of LSPs/spans being\
      recovered (this implies efficient failure correlation, fast\
      failure notification, and time-efficient recovery mechanisms).\
\
   3. Robustness (availability): minimize the LSP/span downtime\
      independently of the underlying topology of the transport plane\
      (this implies a highly responsive recovery mechanism).\
\
   4. Resource optimization (optimality): minimize the resource\
      capacity, including LSPs/spans and nodes (switching capacity),\
      required for recovery purposes; this dimension can also be\
      referred to as optimizing the sharing degree of the recovery\
      resources.\
\
   5. Cost optimization: provide a cost-effective recovery type/scheme.\
\
   However, these dimensions are either outside the scope of this\
   document (such as cost optimization and recovery path computational\
   aspects) or mutually conflicting.  For instance, it is obvious that\
   providing a 1+1 LSP protection minimizes the LSP downtime (in case of\
   failure) while being non-scalable and consuming recovery resource\
   without enabling any extra-traffic.\
\
   The following sections analyze the recovery phases and mechanisms\
   detailed in the previous sections with respect to the dimensions\
   described above in order to assess the GMPLS protocol suite\
   capabilities and applicability.  In turn, this allows the evaluation\
   of the potential need for further GMPLS signaling and routing\
   extensions.\

\
8.1.  Fast Convergence (Detection/Correlation and Hold-off Time)\
\
   Fast convergence is related to the failure management operations.  It\
   refers to the time elapsed between failure detection/correlation and\
   hold-off time, the point at which the recovery switching actions are\
   initiated.  This point has been detailed in Section 4.\
\
8.2.  Efficiency (Recovery Switching Time)\
\
   In general, the more pre-assignment/pre-planning of the recovery\
   LSP/span, the more rapid the recovery is.  Because protection implies\
   pre-assignment (and cross-connection) of the protection resources, in\
   general, protection recovers faster than restoration.\
\
   Span restoration is likely to be slower than most span protection\
   types; however this greatly depends on the efficiency of the span\
   restoration signaling.  LSP restoration with pre-signaled and pre-\
   selected recovery resources is likely to be faster than fully dynamic\
   LSP restoration, especially because of the elimination of any\
   potential crankback during the recovery LSP establishment.\
\
   If one excludes the crankback issue, the difference between dynamic\
   and pre-planned restoration depends on the restoration path\
   computation and selection time.  Since computational considerations\
   are outside the scope of this document, it is up to the vendor to\
   determine the average and maximum path computation time in different\
   scenarios and to the operator to decide whether or not dynamic\
   restoration is advantageous over pre-planned schemes that depend on\
   the network environment.  This difference also depends on the\
   flexibility provided by pre-planned restoration versus dynamic\
   restoration.  Pre-planned restoration implies a somewhat limited\
   number of failure scenarios (that can be due, for instance, to local\
   storage capacity limitation).  Dynamic restoration enables on-demand\
   path computation based on the information received through failure\
   notification message, and as such, it is more robust with respect to\
   the failure scenario scope.\
\
   Moreover, LSP segment restoration, in particular, dynamic restoration\
   (i.e., no path pre-computation, so none of the recovery resource is\
   pre-reserved) will generally be faster than end-to-end LSP\
   restoration.  However, local LSP restoration assumes that each LSP\
   segment end-point has enough computational capacity to perform this\
   operation while end-to-end LSP restoration requires only that LSP\
   end-points provide this path computation capability.\
\
   Recovery time objectives for SONET/SDH protection switching (not\
   including time to detect failure) are specified in [G.841] at 50 ms,\
   taking into account constraints on distance, number of connections\

\
\
   involved, and in the case of ring enhanced protection, number of\
   nodes in the ring.  Recovery time objectives for restoration\
   mechanisms have been proposed through a separate effort [RFC3386].\
\
8.3.  Robustness\
\
   In general, the less pre-assignment (protection)/pre-planning\
   (restoration) of the recovery LSP/span, the more robust the recovery\
   type or scheme is to a variety of single failures, provided that\
   adequate resources are available.  Moreover, the pre-selection of the\
   recovery resources gives (in the case of multiple failure scenarios)\
   less flexibility than no recovery resource pre-selection.  For\
   instance, if failures occur that affect two LSPs sharing a common\
   link along their restoration paths, then only one of these LSPs can\
   be recovered.  This occurs unless the restoration path of at least\
   one of these LSPs is re-computed, or the local resource assignment is\
   modified on the fly.\
\
   In addition, recovery types and schemes with pre-planned recovery\
   resources (in particular, LSP/spans for protection and LSPs for\
   restoration purposes) will not be able to recover from failures that\
   simultaneously affect both the working and recovery LSP/span.  Thus,\
   the recovery resources should ideally be as disjoint as possible\
   (with respect to link, node, and SRLG) from the working ones, so that\
   any single failure event will not affect both working and recovery\
   LSP/span.  In brief, working and recovery resources must be fully\
   diverse in order to guarantee that a given failure will not affect\
   simultaneously the working and the recovery LSP/span.  Also, the risk\
   of simultaneous failure of the working and the recovery LSPs can be\
   reduced.  It is reduced by computing a new recovery path whenever a\
   failure occurs along one of the recovery LSPs or by computing a new\
   recovery path and provision the corresponding LSP whenever a failure\
   occurs along a working LSP/span.  Both methods enable the network to\
   maintain the number of available recovery path constant.\
\
   The robustness of a recovery scheme is also determined by the amount\
   of pre-reserved (i.e., signaled) recovery resources within a given\
   shared resource pool: as the sharing degree of recovery resources\
   increases, the recovery scheme becomes less robust to multiple\
   LSP/span failure occurrences.  Recovery schemes, in particular\
   restoration, with pre-signaled resource reservation (with or without\
   pre-selection) should be capable of reserving an adequate amount of\
   resource to ensure recovery from any specific set of failure events,\
   such as any single SRLG failure, any two SRLG failures, etc.\

\
\
8.4.  Resource Optimization\
\
   It is commonly admitted that sharing recovery resources provides\
   network resource optimization.  Therefore, from a resource\
   utilization perspective, protection schemes are often classified with\
   respect to their degree of sharing recovery resources with the\
   working entities.  Moreover, non-permanent bridging protection types\
   allow (under normal conditions) for extra-traffic over the recovery\
   resources.\
\
   From this perspective, the following statements are true:\
\
   1) 1+1 LSP/Span protection is the most resource-consuming protection\
      type because it does not allow for any extra traffic.\
\
   2) 1:1 LSP/span recovery requires dedicated recovery LSP/span\
      allowing for extra traffic.\
\
   3) 1:N and M:N LSP/span recovery require 1 (and M, respectively)\
      recovery LSP/span (shared between the N working LSP/span) allowing\
      for extra traffic.\
\
   Obviously, 1+1 protection precludes, and 1:1 recovery does not allow\
   for any recovery LSP/span sharing, whereas 1:N and M:N recovery do\
   allow sharing of 1 (M, respectively) recovery LSP/spans between N\
   working LSP/spans.  However, despite the fact that 1:1 LSP recovery\
   precludes the sharing of the recovery LSP, the recovery schemes that\
   can be built from it (e.g., (1:1)^n, see Section 5.4) do allow\
   sharing of its recovery resources.  In addition, the flexibility in\
   the usage of shared recovery resources (in particular, shared links)\
   may be limited because of network topology restrictions, e.g., fixed\
   ring topology for traditional enhanced protection schemes.\
\
   On the other hand, when using LSP restoration with pre-signaled\
   resource reservation, the amount of reserved restoration capacity is\
   determined by the local bandwidth reservation policies.  In LSP\
   restoration schemes with re-provisioning, a pool of spare resources\
   can be defined from which all resources are selected after failure\
   occurrence for the purpose of restoration path computation.  The\
   degree to which restoration schemes allow sharing amongst multiple\
   independent failures is then directly inferred from the size of the\
   resource pool.  Moreover, in all restoration schemes, spare resources\
   can be used to carry preemptible traffic (thus over preemptible\
   LSP/span) when the corresponding resources have not been committed\
   for LSP/span recovery purposes.\
\
   From this, it clearly follows that less recovery resources (i.e.,\
   LSP/spans and switching capacity) have to be allocated to a shared\
\
\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   recovery resource pool if a greater sharing degree is allowed.  Thus,\
   the network survivability level is determined by the policy that\
   defines the amount of shared recovery resources and by the maximum\
   sharing degree allowed for these recovery resources.\
\
8.4.1.  Recovery Resource Sharing\
\
   When recovery resources are shared over several LSP/Spans, the use of\
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, the Unreserved Bandwidth, and the\
   Maximum LSP Bandwidth (see [RFC4202]) provides the information needed\
   to obtain the optimization of the network resources allocated for\
   shared recovery purposes.\
\
   The Maximum Reservable Bandwidth is defined as the Maximum Link\
   Bandwidth but it may be greater in case of link over-subscription.\
\
   The Unreserved Bandwidth (at priority p) is defined as the bandwidth\
   not yet reserved on a given TE link (its initial value for each\
   priority p corresponds to the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth).  Last,\
   the Maximum LSP Bandwidth (at priority p) is defined as the smaller\
   of Unreserved Bandwidth (at priority p) and Maximum Link Bandwidth.\
\
   Here, one generally considers a recovery resource sharing degree (or\
   ratio) to globally optimize the shared recovery resource usage.  The\
   distribution of the bandwidth utilization per TE link can be inferred\
   from the per-priority bandwidth pre-allocation.  By using the Maximum\
   LSP Bandwidth and the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, the amount of\
   (over-provisioned) resources that can be used for shared recovery\
   purposes is known from the IGP.\
\
   In order to analyze this behavior, we define the difference between\
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (in the present case, this value is\
   greater than the Maximum Link Bandwidth) and the Maximum LSP\
   Bandwidth per TE link i as the Maximum Shareable Bandwidth or\
   max_R[i].  Within this quantity, the amount of bandwidth currently\
   allocated for shared recovery per TE link i is defined as R[i].  Both\
   quantities are expressed in terms of discrete bandwidth units (and\
   thus, the Minimum LSP Bandwidth is of one bandwidth unit).\
\
   The knowledge of this information available per TE link can be\
   exploited in order to optimize the usage of the resources allocated\
   per TE link for shared recovery.  If one refers to r[i] as the actual\
   bandwidth per TE link i (in terms of discrete bandwidth units)\
   committed for shared recovery, then the following quantity must be\
   maximized over the potential TE link candidates:\
\
        sum {i=1}^N [(R{i} - r{i})/(t{i} - b{i})]\
\
\
\
\
Papadimitriou & Mannie       Informational                     [Page 37]\
\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
        or equivalently: sum {i=1}^N [(R{i} - r{i})/r{i}]\
\
        with R{i} >= 1 and r{i} >= 1 (in terms of per component\
        bandwidth unit)\
\
   In this formula, N is the total number of links traversed by a given\
   LSP, t[i] the Maximum Link Bandwidth per TE link i, and b[i] the sum\
   per TE link i of the bandwidth committed for working LSPs and other\
   recovery LSPs (thus except "shared bandwidth" LSPs).  The quantity\
   [(R{i} - r{i})/r{i}] is defined as the Shared (Recovery) Bandwidth\
   Ratio per TE link i.  In addition, TE links for which R[i] reaches\
   max_R[i] or for which r[i] = 0 are pruned during shared recovery path\
   computation as well as TE links for which max_R[i] = r[i] that can\
   simply not be shared.\
\
   More generally, one can draw the following mapping between the\
   available bandwidth at the transport and control plane level:\
\
                                 - ---------- Max Reservable Bandwidth\
                                |  -----  ^\
                                |R -----  |\
                                |  -----  |\
                                 - -----  |max_R\
                                   -----  |\
   --------  TE link Capacity    - ------ | - Maximum TE Link Bandwidth\
   -----                        |r -----  v\
   -----     <------ b ------>   - ---------- Maximum LSP Bandwidth\
   -----                           -----\
   -----                           -----\
   -----                           -----\
   -----                           -----\
   -----                           ----- <--- Minimum LSP Bandwidth\
   -------- 0                      ---------- 0\
\
   Note that the above approach does not require the flooding of any per\
   LSP information or any detailed distribution of the bandwidth\
   allocation per component link or individual ports or even any per-\
   priority shareable recovery bandwidth information (using a dedicated\
   sub-TLV).  The latter would provide the same capability as the\
   already defined Maximum LSP bandwidth per-priority information.  This\
   approach is referred to as a Partial (or Aggregated) Information\
   Routing as described in [KODIALAM1] and [KODIALAM2].  They show that\
   the difference obtained with a Full (or Complete) Information Routing\
   approach (where for the whole set of working and recovery LSPs, the\
   amount of bandwidth units they use per-link is known at each node and\
   for each link) is clearly negligible.  The Full Information Routing\

\
\
   approach is detailed in [GLI].  Note also that both approaches rely\
   on the deterministic knowledge (at different degrees) of the network\
   topology and resource usage status.\
\
   Moreover, extending the GMPLS signaling capabilities can enhance the\
   Partial Information Routing approach.  It is enhanced by allowing\
   working-LSP-related information and, in particular, its path\
   (including link and node identifiers) to be exchanged with the\
   recovery LSP request.  This enables more efficient admission control\
   at upstream nodes of shared recovery resources, and in particular,\
   links (see Section 8.4.3).\
\
8.4.2.  Recovery Resource Sharing and SRLG Recovery\
\
   Resource shareability can also be maximized with respect to the\
   number of times each SRLG is protected by a recovery resource (in\
   particular, a shared TE link) and methods can be considered for\
   avoiding contention of the shared recovery resources in case of\
   single SRLG failure.  These methods enable the sharing of recovery\
   resources between two (or more) recovery LSPs, if their respective\
   working LSPs are mutually disjoint with respect to link, node, and\
   SRLGs.  Then, a single failure does not simultaneously disrupt\
   several (or at least two) working LSPs.\
\
   For instance, [BOUILLET] shows that the Partial Information Routing\
   approach can be extended to cover recovery resource shareability with\
   respect to SRLG recoverability (i.e., the number of times each SRLG\
   is recoverable).  By flooding this aggregated information per TE\
   link, path computation and selection of SRLG-diverse recovery LSPs\
   can be optimized with respect to the sharing of recovery resource\
   reserved on each TE link.  This yields a performance difference of\
   less than 5%, which is negligible compared to the corresponding Full\
   Information Flooding approach (see [GLI]).\
\
   For this purpose, additional extensions to [RFC4202] in support of\
   path computation for shared mesh recovery have been often considered\
   in the literature.  TE link attributes would include, among others,\
   the current number of recovery LSPs sharing the recovery resources\
   reserved on the TE link, and the current number of SRLGs recoverable\
   by this amount of (shared) recovery resources reserved on the TE\
   link.  The latter is equivalent to the current number of SRLGs that\
   will be recovered by the recovery LSPs sharing the recovery resource\
   reserved on the TE link.  Then, if explicit SRLG recoverability is\
   considered, a TE link attribute would be added that includes the\
   explicit list of SRLGs (recoverable by the shared recovery resource\
   reserved on the TE link) and their respective shareable recovery\
   bandwidths.  The latter information is equivalent to the shareable\
   recovery bandwidth per SRLG (or per group of SRLGs), which implies\
\
\
\
Papadimitriou & Mannie       Informational                     [Page 39]\
\
RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   that the amount of shareable bandwidth and the number of listed SRLGs\
   will decrease over time.\
\
   Compared to the case of recovery resource sharing only (regardless of\
   SRLG recoverability, as described in Section 8.4.1), these additional\
   TE link attributes would potentially deliver better path computation\
   and selection (at a distinct ingress node) for shared mesh recovery\
   purposes.  However, due to the lack of evidence of better efficiency\
   and due to the complexity that such extensions would generate, they\
   are not further considered in the scope of the present analysis.  For\
   instance, a per-SRLG group minimum/maximum shareable recovery\
   bandwidth is restricted by the length that the corresponding (sub-)\
   TLV may take and thus the number of SRLGs that it can include.\
   Therefore, the corresponding parameter should not be translated into\
   GMPLS routing (or even signaling) protocol extensions in the form of\
   TE link sub-TLV.\
\
8.4.3.  Recovery Resource Sharing, SRLG Disjointness and Admission\
        Control\
\
   Admission control is a strict requirement to be fulfilled by nodes\
   giving access to shared links.  This can be illustrated using the\
   following network topology:\
\
      A ------ C ====== D\
      |        |        |\
      |        |        |\
      |        B        |\
      |        |        |\
      |        |        |\
       ------- E ------ F\
\
   Node A creates a working LSP to D (A-C-D), B creates simultaneously a\
   working LSP to D (B-C-D) and a recovery LSP (B-E-F-D) to the same\
   destination.  Then, A decides to create a recovery LSP to D (A-E-F-\
   D), but since the C-D span carries both working LSPs, node E should\
   either assign a dedicated resource for this recovery LSP or reject\
   this request if the C-D span has already reached its maximum recovery\
   bandwidth sharing ratio.  In the latter case, C-D span failure would\
   imply that one of the working LSP would not be recoverable.\
\
   Consequently, node E must have the required information to perform\
   admission control for the recovery LSP requests it processes\
   (implying for instance, that the path followed by the working LSP is\
   carried with the corresponding recovery LSP request).  If node E can\
   guarantee that the working LSPs (A-C-D and B-C-D) are SRLG disjoint\
   over the C-D span, it may securely accept the incoming recovery LSP\
   request and assign to the recovery LSPs (A-E-F-D and B-E-F-D) the\
\
\
\

RFC 4428               GMPLS Recovery Mechanisms              March 2006\
\
\
   same resources on the link E-F.  This may occur if the link E-F has\
   not yet reached its maximum recovery bandwidth sharing ratio.  In\
   this example, one assumes that the node failure probability is\
   negligible compared to the link failure probability.\
\
   To achieve this, the path followed by the working LSP is transported\
   with the recovery LSP request and examined at each upstream node of\
   potentially shareable links.  Admission control is performed using\
   the interface identifiers (included in the path) to retrieve in the\
   TE DataBase the list of SRLG IDs associated to each of the working\
   LSP links.  If the working LSPs (A-C-D and B-C-D) have one or more\
   link or SRLG ID in common (in this example, one or more SRLG id in\
   common over the span C-D), node E should not assign the same resource\
   over link E-F to the recovery LSPs (A-E-F-D and B-E-F-D).  Otherwise,\
   one of these working LSPs would not be recoverable if C-D span\
   failure occurred.\
\
   There are some issues related to this method; the major one is the\
   number of SRLG IDs that a single link can cover (more than 100, in\
   complex environments).  Moreover, when using link bundles, this\
   approach may generate the rejection of some recovery LSP requests.\
   This occurs when the SRLG sub-TLV corresponding to a link bundle\
   includes the union of the SRLG id list of all the component links\
   belonging to this bundle (see [RFC4202] and [RFC4201]).\
\
   In order to overcome this specific issue, an additional mechanism may\
   consist of querying the nodes where the information would be\
   available (in this case, node E would query C).  The main drawback of\
   this method is that (in addition to the dedicated mechanism(s) it\
   requires) it may become complex when several common nodes are\
   traversed by the working LSPs.  Therefore, when using link bundles,\
   solving this issue is closely related to the sequence of the recovery\
   operations.  Per-component flooding of SRLG identifiers would deeply\
   impact the scalability of the link state routing protocol.\
   Therefore, one may rely on the usage of an on-line accessible network\
   management system.\

   1a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource\
       reservation (i.e., signaling) and selection is referred to as LSP\
       protection.\
\
   2a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource\
       reservation (i.e., signaling) and with resource pre-selection is\
       referred to as pre-planned LSP re-routing with resource pre-\
       selection.  This implies only recovery LSP activation after\
       failure occurrence.\
\
   3a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource\
       reservation (i.e., signaling) and without resource selection is\
       referred to as pre-planned LSP re-routing without resource pre-\
       selection.  This implies recovery LSP activation and resource\
       (i.e., label) selection after failure occurrence.\
\
   3b. Recovery LSP setup after failure occurrence is referred to as to\
       as LSP re-routing, which is full when recovery LSP path\
       computation occurs after failure occurrence.\

\
\
   Thus, the term pre-planned refers to recovery LSP path pre-\
   computation, signaling (reservation), and a priori resource selection\
   (optional), but not cross-connection.  Also, the shared-mesh recovery\
   scheme can be viewed as a particular case of 2a) and 3a), using the\
   additional constraint described in Section 8.4.3.\
\
   The implementation of these recovery mechanisms requires only\
   considering extensions to GMPLS signaling protocols (i.e., [RFC3471]\
   and [RFC3473]).  These GMPLS signaling extensions should mainly focus\
   in delivering (1) recovery LSP pre-provisioning for the cases 1a, 2a,\
   and 3a, (2) LSP failure notification, (3) recovery LSP switching\
   action(s), and (4) reversion mechanisms.\
\
   Moreover, the present analysis (see Section 8) shows that no GMPLS\
   routing extensions are expected to efficiently implement any of these\
   recovery types and schemes.\
\
10.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document does not introduce any additional security issue or\
   imply any specific security consideration from [RFC3945] to the\
   current RSVP-TE GMPLS signaling, routing protocols (OSPF-TE, IS-IS-\
   TE) or network management protocols.\
\
   However, the authorization of requests for resources by GMPLS-capable\
   nodes should determine whether a given party, presumably already\
   authenticated, has a right to access the requested resources.  This\
   determination is typically a matter of local policy control, for\
   example, by setting limits on the total bandwidth made available to\
   some party in the presence of resource contention.  Such policies may\
   become quite complex as the number of users, types of resources, and\
   sophistication of authorization rules increases.  This is\
   particularly the case for recovery schemes that assume pre-planned\
   sharing of recovery resources, or contention for resources in case of\
   dynamic re-routing.\
\
   Therefore, control elements should match the requests against the\
   local authorization policy.  These control elements must be capable\
   of making decisions based on the identity of the requester, as\
   verified cryptographically and/or topologically.\

Abstract\
\
   This document describes the Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys\
   (KINK) protocol.  KINK defines a low-latency, computationally\
   inexpensive, easily managed, and cryptographically sound protocol to\
   establish and maintain security associations using the Kerberos\
   authentication system.  KINK reuses the Quick Mode payloads of the\
   Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which should lead to substantial reuse\
   of existing IKE implementations.\

RFC 4430                          KINK                        March 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   KINK is designed to provide a secure, scalable mechanism for\
   establishing keys between communicating entities within a centrally\
   managed environment in which it is important to maintain consistent\
   security policy.  The security goals of KINK are to provide privacy,\
   authentication, and replay protection of key management messages and\
   to avoid denial of service vulnerabilities whenever possible.  The\
   performance goals of the protocol are to have a low computational\
   cost, low latency, and a small footprint.  It is also to avoid or\
   minimize the use of public key operations.  In particular, the\
   protocol provides the capability to establish IPsec security\
   associations (SAs) in two messages with minimal computational effort.\
   These requirements are described in RFC 3129 [REQ4KINK].\
\
   Kerberos [KERBEROS] provides an efficient authentication mechanism\
   for clients and servers using a trusted third-party model.  Kerberos\
   also provides a mechanism for cross-realm authentication natively.  A\
   client obtains a ticket from an online authentication server, the Key\
   Distribution Center (KDC).  The ticket is then used to construct a\
   credential for authenticating the client to the server.  As a result\
   of this authentication operation, the server will also share a secret\
   key with the client.  KINK uses this property as the basis of\
   distributing keys for IPsec.\
\
   The central key management provided by Kerberos is efficient because\
   it limits computational cost and limits complexity versus IKE's\
   necessity of using public key cryptography [IKE].  Initial\
   authentication to the KDC may be performed using either symmetric\
   keys, or asymmetric keys using the Public Key Cryptography for\
   Initial Authentication in Kerberos [PKINIT]; however, subsequent\
   requests for tickets as well as authenticated exchanges between the\
   client and servers always utilize symmetric cryptography.  Therefore,\
   public key operations (if any) are limited and are amortized over the\
   lifetime of the credentials acquired in the initial authentication\
   operation to the KDC.  For example, a client may use a single public\
   key exchange with the KDC to efficiently establish multiple SAs with\
   many other servers in the realm of the KDC.  Kerberos also scales\
   better than direct peer-to-peer keying when symmetric keys are used.\
   The reason is that since the keys are stored in the KDC, the number\
   of principal keys is O(n+m) rather than O(n*m), where "n" is the\
   number of clients and "m" is the number of servers.\

   It is assumed that the readers are familiar with the terms and\
   concepts described in Kerberos Version 5 [KERBEROS], IPsec [IPSEC],\
   and IKE [IKE].\
\
2.  Protocol Overview\
\
   KINK is a command/response protocol that can create, delete, and\
   maintain IPsec SAs.  Each command or response contains a common\
   header along with a set of type-length-value payloads.  The type of a\
   command or a response constrains the payloads sent in the messages of\
   the exchange.  KINK itself is a stateless protocol in that each\
   command or response does not require storage of hard state for KINK.\
   This is in contrast to IKE, which uses Main Mode to first establish\
   an Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)\
   SA followed by subsequent Quick Mode exchanges.\
\
   KINK uses Kerberos mechanisms to provide mutual authentication and\
   replay protection.  For establishing SAs, KINK provides\
   confidentiality for the payloads that follow the Kerberos AP-REQ\
   payload.  The design of KINK mitigates denial of service attacks by\
   requiring authenticated exchanges before the use of any public key\
   operations and the installation of any state.  KINK also provides a\
   means of using Kerberos User-to-User mechanisms when there is not a\
   key shared between the server and the KDC.  This is typically, but\
   not limited to, the case with IPsec peers using PKINIT for initial\
   authentication.\
\
   KINK directly reuses Quick Mode payloads defined in section 5.5 of\
   [IKE], with some minor changes and omissions.  In most cases, KINK\
   exchanges are a single command and its response.  An optional third\
   message is required when creating SAs, only if the responder rejects\
   the first proposal from the initiator or wants to contribute the\
   keying materials.  KINK also provides rekeying and dead peer\
   detection.\
\
3.  Message Flows\
\
   All KINK message flows follow the same pattern between the two peers:\
   a command, a response, and an optional acknowledgement in a CREATE\
   flow.  A command is a GETTGT, CREATE, DELETE, or STATUS message; a\
   response is a REPLY message; and an acknowledgement is an ACK\
   message.\
\
   KINK uses Kerberos as the authentication mechanism; therefore, a KINK\
   host needs to get a service ticket for each peer before actual key\
   negotiations.  This is basically a pure Kerberos exchange and the\
   actual KDC traffic here is for illustrative purposes only.  In\
   practice, when a principal obtains various tickets is a subject of\

\
\
   Kerberos and local policy consideration.  As an exception, the GETTGT\
   message flow of KINK (described in section 3.1) is used when a User-\
   to-User authentication is required.  In this flow, we assume that\
   both A and B have ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) from their KDCs.\
\
   After a service ticket is obtained, KINK uses the CREATE message flow\
   (section 3.2), DELETE message flow (section 3.3), and STATUS message\
   flow (section 3.4) to manage SAs.  In these flows, we assume that A\
   has a service ticket for B.\
\
3.1.  GETTGT Message Flow\
\
   This flow is used to retrieve a TGT from the remote peer in User-to-\
   User authentication mode.\
\
   If the initiator determines that it will not be able to get a normal\
   (non-User-to-User) service ticket for the responder, it can try a\
   User-to-User authentication.  In this case, it first fetches a TGT\
   from the responder in order to get a User-to-User service ticket:\
\
       A                        B                       KDC\
     ------                  ------                     ---\

\
   The initiator MAY support the following events as triggers to go to\
   the User-to-User path.  Note that the two errors described below will\
   not be authenticated, and how to act on them depends on the policy.\
\
        o    The local policy says that the responder requires a User-\
             to-User authentication.\
\
        o    A KRB_AP_ERR_USER_TO_USER_REQUIRED error is returned from\
             the responder.\

             KDC.\

\
\
3.2.  CREATE Message Flow\
\
   This flow creates SAs.  The CREATE command takes an "optimistic"\
   approach, where SAs are initially created on the expectation that the\
   responder will choose the initial proposed payload.  The optimistic\
   proposal is placed in the first transform payload(s) of the first\
   proposal.  The initiator MUST check to see if the optimistic proposal\
   was selected by comparing all transforms and attributes, which MUST\
   be identical to those in the initiator's optimistic proposal with the\
   exceptions of LIFE_KILOBYTES and LIFE_SECONDS.  Each of these\
   attributes MAY be set to a lower value by the responder and still\
   expect optimistic keying, but MUST NOT be set to a higher value that\
   MUST generate a NO-PROPOSAL-CHOSEN error.  The initiator MUST use the\
   shorter lifetime.\
\
   When a CREATE command contains an existing Security Parameter Index\
   (SPI), the responder MUST reject it and SHOULD return an ISAKMP\
   notification with INVALID-SPI.\
\
   When a key exchange (KE) payload is sent from the initiator but the\
   responder does not support it, the responder MUST reject it with an\
   ISAKMP notification of INVALID-PAYLOAD-TYPE containing a KE payload\
   type as its notification data.  When the initiator receives this\
   error, it MAY retry without a KE payload (as another transaction) if\
   its policy allows that.\

\
\
   Creating SAs has two modes:  2-way handshake and 3-way handshake.\
   The initiator usually begins a negotiation expecting a 2-way\
   handshake.  When the optimistic proposal is not chosen by the\
   responder, the negotiation is switched to a 3-way handshake.  When\
   and only when the initiator uses a KE payload, 3-way handshake is\
   expected from the beginning.\
\
   A 2-way handshake is performed in the following steps:\
\
      1) The host A creates an inbound SA (B->A) in its SA database\
         using the optimistic proposal in the ISAKMP SA proposal.  It is\
         then ready to receive any messages from B.\
      2) A then sends the CREATE message to B.\
      3) If B agrees to A's optimistic proposal, B creates an inbound SA\
         (A->B) and an outbound SA (B->A) in its database.  If B does\
         not choose the first proposal or wants to add a Nonce payload,\
         switch to step 3 of the 3-way handshake described below.\
      4) B then sends a REPLY to A without a Nonce payload and without\
         requesting an ACK.\
      5) Upon receipt of the REPLY, A creates an outbound SA (A->B).\
\
   A 3-way handshake is performed in the following steps:\
\
      1) The host A sends the CREATE message to B without creating any\
         SA.\
      2) B chooses one proposal according to its policy.\
      3) B creates an inbound SA (A->B) and sends the actual choice in\
         the REPLY.  It SHOULD send the optional Nonce payload (as it\
         does not increase message count and generally increases entropy\
         sources) and MUST request that the REPLY be acknowledged.\
      4) Upon receipt of the REPLY, A creates the inbound SA (B->A) (or\
         modifies it as necessary, if switched from 2-way), and the\
         outbound SA (A->B).\
      5) A now sends the ACK message.\
      6) Upon receipt of the ACK, B installs the final outbound SA\
         (B->A).\
\
   If B does not choose the first proposal, adds a nonce, or accepts the\
   KE exchange, then it MUST request an ACK (i.e., set the ACKREQ bit)\
   so that it can install the final outbound SA.  The initiator MUST\
   always generate an ACK if the ACKREQ bit is set in the KINK header,\
   even if it believes that the responder was in error.\
\
3.2.1.  CREATE Key Derivation Considerations\
\
   The CREATE command's optimistic approach allows an SA to be created\
   in two messages rather than three.  The implication of a two-message\
   exchange is that B will not contribute to the key since A must set up\

\
\
   the inbound SA before it receives any additional keying material from\
   B.  This may be suspect under normal circumstances; however, KINK\
   takes advantage of the fact that the KDC provides a reliable source\
   of randomness which is used in key derivation.  In many cases, this\
   will provide an adequate session key so that B will not require an\
   acknowledgement.  Since B is always at liberty to contribute to the\
   keying material, this is strictly a trade-off between the key\
   strength versus the number of messages, which KINK implementations\
   may decide as a matter of policy.\
\
3.3.  DELETE Message Flow\
\
   The DELETE command deletes existing SAs.  The domain of\
   interpretation (DOI)-specific payloads describe the actual SA to be\
   deleted.  For the IPsec DOI, those payloads will include an ISAKMP\
   payload containing the list of the SPIs to be deleted.\
\
       A                        B                       KDC\
     ------                  ------                     ---\
\
       A deletes outbound SA to B.\
\
    1  DELETE+ISAKMP------------>\
\
       B deletes inbound and outbound SA to A.\
\
    2  <-------------REPLY+ISAKMP\
\
       A deletes inbound SA to B.\
\
                       Figure 3: DELETE Message Flow\
\
   The DELETE command takes a "pessimistic" approach, which does not\
   delete inbound SAs until it receives acknowledgement that the other\
   host has received the DELETE.  The exception to the pessimistic\
   approach is if the initiator wants to immediately cease all activity\
   on an inbound SA.  In this case, it MAY delete the inbound SA as well\
   in step 1, above.\
\
   The ISAKMP payload contains ISAKMP Delete payload(s) that indicate\
   the inbound SA(s) for the initiator of this flow.  KINK does not\
   allow half-open SAs; thus, when the responder receives a DELETE\
   command, it MUST delete SAs of both directions, and MUST reply with\
   ISAKMP Delete payload(s) that indicate the inbound SA(s) for the\
   responder of this flow.  If the responder cannot find an appropriate\
   SPI to be deleted, it MUST return an ISAKMP notification with\
   INVALID_SPI, which also serves to inform the initiator that it can\
   delete the inbound SA.\

\
\
   A race condition with the DELETE flow exists.  Due to network\
   reordering, etc., packets in flight while the DELETE operation is\
   taking place may arrive after the diagrams above, which recommend\
   deleting the inbound SA.  A KINK implementation SHOULD implement a\
   grace timer that SHOULD be set to a period of at least two times the\
   average round-trip time, or to a configurable value.  A KINK\
   implementation MAY choose to set the grace period to zero at\
   appropriate times to delete an SA ungracefully.  The behavior\
   described here is referred from the behavior of the TCP [RFC793]\
   flags FIN and RST.\
\
3.4.  STATUS Message Flow\
\
   This flow is used to send any information to a peer or to elicit any\
   information from a peer.  An initiator may send a STATUS command to\
   the responder at any time, optionally with DOI-specific ISAKMP\
   payloads.  In the case of the IPsec DOI, these are generally in the\
   form of ISAKMP Notification payloads.  A STATUS command is also used\
   as a means of dead peer detection described in section 3.7.\

\
    2  <-----------REPLY[+ISAKMP]\
\
                       Figure 4: STATUS Message Flow\
\
3.5.  Reporting Errors\
\
   When the responder detects an error in a received command, it can\
   send a DOI-specific payload to indicate the error in a REPLY message.\
   There are three types of payloads that can indicate errors:\
   KINK_KRB_ERROR payloads for Kerberos errors, KINK_ERROR payloads for\
   KINK errors, and KINK_ISAKMP payloads for ISAKMP errors.  Details are\
   described in sections 4.2.3, 4.2.8, and 4.2.6, respectively.\
\
   If the initiator detects an error in a received reply, there is no\
   means to report it back to the responder.  The initiator SHOULD log\
   the event and MAY take a remedial action by reinitiating the initial\
   command.\
\
   If the server clock and the client clock are off by more than the\
   policy-determined clock skew limit (usually 5 minutes), the server\
   MUST return a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW.  The optional client's time in the\
   KRB-ERROR SHOULD be filled out.  If the server protects the error by\
   adding the Cksum field and returning the correct client's time, the\

\
\
   client SHOULD compute the difference (in seconds) between the two\
   clocks based upon the client and server time contained in the\
   KRB-ERROR message.  The client SHOULD store this clock difference and\
   use it to adjust its clock in subsequent messages.  If the error is\
   not protected, the client MUST NOT use the difference to adjust\
   subsequent messages, because doing so would allow an attacker to\
   construct authenticators that can be used to mount replay attacks.\
\
3.6.  Rekeying Security Associations\
\
   KINK expects the initiator of an SA to be responsible for rekeying\
   the SA for two reasons.  The first reason is to prevent needless\
   duplication of SAs as the result of collisions due to an initiator\
   and responder both trying to renew an existing SA.  The second reason\
   is due to the client/server nature of Kerberos exchanges, which\
   expects the client to get and maintain tickets.  While KINK expects\
   that a KINK host is able to get and maintain tickets, in practice it\
   is often advantageous for servers to wait for clients to initiate\
   sessions so that they do not need to maintain a large ticket cache.\
\
   There are no special semantics for rekeying SAs in KINK.  That is, in\
   order to rekey an existing SA, the initiator must CREATE a new SA\
   followed by either deleting the old SA with the DELETE flow or\
   letting it time out.  When identical flow selectors are available on\
   different SAs, KINK implementations SHOULD choose the SA most\
   recently created.  It should be noted that KINK avoids most of the\
   problems of [IKE] rekeying by having a reliable delete mechanism.\
\
   Normally, a KINK implementation that rekeys existing SAs will try to\
   rekey the SA ahead of an SA termination, which may include the hard\
   lifetime in time/bytecount or the overflow of the sequence number\
   counter.  We call this time "soft lifetime".  The soft lifetime MUST\
   be randomized to avoid synchronization with similar implementations.\
   In the case of the lifetime in time, one reasonable approach to\
   determine the soft lifetime is picking a random time between T-rekey\
   and T-retrans and subtracting it from the hard lifetime.  Here,\
   T-rekey is the reasonable maximum rekeying margin, and T-retrans is\
   the amount of time it would take to go through a full retransmission\
   cycle.  T-rekey SHOULD be at least twice as high as T-retrans.\
\
3.7.  Dead Peer Detection\
\
   In order to determine that a KINK peer has lost its security database\
   information, KINK peers MUST record the current epoch for which they\
   have valid SA information for a peer and reflect that epoch in each\
   AP-REQ and AP-REP message.  When a KINK peer creates state for a\
   given SA, it MUST also record the principal's epoch.  If it discovers\
\

\
\
   on a subsequent message that the principal's epoch has changed, it\
   MUST consider all SAs created by that principal as invalid, and take\
   some action such as tearing those SAs down.\
\
   While a KINK peer SHOULD use feedback from routing (in the form of\
   ICMP messages) as a trigger to check whether or not the peer is still\
   alive, a KINK peer MUST NOT conclude the peer is dead simply based on\
   unprotected routing information (said ICMP messages).\
\
   If there is suspicion that a peer may be dead (based on any\
   information available to the KINK peer, including lack of IPsec\
   traffic, etc.), the KINK STATUS message SHOULD be used to coerce an\
   acknowledgement out of the peer.  Since nothing is negotiated about\
   dead peer detection in KINK, each peer can decide its own metric for\
   "suspicion" and also what timeouts to use before declaring a peer\
   dead due to lack of response to the STATUS message.  This is\
   desirable, and does not break interoperability.\
\
   The STATUS message has a twofold effect.  First, it elicits a\
   cryptographically secured (and replay-protected) response from the\
   peer, which tells us whether or not the peer is reachable/alive.\
   Second, it carries the epoch number of the peer, so we know whether\
   or not the peer has rebooted and lost all state.  This is crucial to\
   the KINK protocol: In IKE, if a peer reboots, we lose all\
   cryptographic context, and no cryptographically secure communication\
   is possible without renegotiating keys.  In KINK, due to Kerberos\
   tickets, we can communicate securely with a peer, even if the peer\
   rebooted, as the shared cryptographic key used is carried in the\
   Kerberos ticket.  Thus, active cryptographic communication is not an\
   indication that the peer has not rebooted and lost all state, and the\
   epoch is needed.\
\
   Assume a Peer A sending a STATUS and a peer B sending the REPLY (see\
   section 3.4).  Peer B MAY assume that the sender is alive, and the\
   epoch in the STATUS message will indicate whether or not the peer A\
   has lost state.  Peer B MUST acknowledge the STATUS message with a\
   REPLY message, as described in section 3.4.\
\
   The REPLY message will indicate to peer A that the peer is alive, and\
   the epoch in the REPLY will indicate whether peer B has lost its\
   state or not.  If peer A does not receive a REPLY message from peer B\
   in a suitable timeout, peer A MAY send another STATUS message.  It is\
   up to peer A to decide how aggressively to declare peer B dead.  The\
   level of aggressiveness may depend on many factors such as rapid fail\
   over versus number of messages sent by nodes with large numbers of\
   SAs.\

\
\
   Note that peer B MUST NOT make any inferences about a lack of STATUS\
   message from peer A.  Peer B MAY use a STATUS message from peer A as\
   an indication of A's aliveness, but peer B MUST NOT expect another\
   STATUS message at any time (i.e., dead peer detection is not periodic\
   keepalives).\
\
   Strategies for sending STATUS messages are the following: Peer A may\
   decide to send a STATUS message only after a prolonged period where\
   no traffic was sent in either direction over the IPsec SAs with the\
   peer.  Once there is traffic, peer A may want to know if the traffic\
   is going into a black hole, and send a STATUS message.\
   Alternatively, peer A may use an idle timer to detect lack of traffic\
   with the peer, and send STATUS messages in the quiet phase to make\
   sure the peer is still alive for when traffic needs to finally be\
   sent.\
\
3.7.1.  Coping with Dead User-to-User Peers\
\
   When an initiator uses a User-to-User ticket and a responder has lost\
   its previous TGT, the usual dead peer detection (DPD) mechanism does\
   not work, because the responder cannot decrypt the ticket with its\
   new TGT.  In this case, the following actions are taken.\
\
     o    When the responder receives a KINK command with a User-to-User\
          ticket that cannot be decrypted with its TGT, it returns a\
          REPLY with a KINK_TGT_REP payload containing the TGT.\
\
     o    When the initiator receives a KINK_TGT_REP, it retrieves a new\
          service ticket with the TGT and retries the command.\
\
   This does not directly define a method to detect a dead User-to-User\
   peer, but to recover from the situation that the responder does not\
   have an appropriate TGT to decrypt a service ticket sent from the\
   initiator.  After recovery, they can exchange their epochs, and usual\
   DPD mechanism will detect a dead peer if it really has been dead.\
\
   The initiator MUST NOT think the peer has been dead on the receipt of\
   a KINK_TGT_REP because of two reasons.  One is that the message is\
   not authenticated, and the other is that losing a TGT does not\
   necessarily mean losing the SA database information.  The initiator\
   SHOULD NOT forget the previous service ticket until the new one is\
   successfully obtained in order to reduce the cost when a forged\
   KINK_TGT_REP is received.\

     o    RESRVED (4 bits) -- Reserved and MUST be zero when sent, MUST\
          be ignored when received.\
\
     o    Length (2 octets) -- Length of the message in octets.  It is\
          not forbidden in KINK that there are unnecessary data after\
          the message, but the Length field MUST represent the actual\
          length of the message.\
\
     o    DOI (4 octets) -- The domain of interpretation.  All DOIs must\
          be registered with the IANA in the ISAKMP Domain of\
          Interpretation section of the isakmp-registry [ISAKMP-REG].\
          The IANA Assigned Number for the Internet IP Security DOI\
          [IPDOI] is one (1).  This field defines the context of all\
          sub-payloads in this message.  If sub-payloads have a DOI\
          field (e.g., Security Association Payload), then the DOI in\
          that sub-payload MUST be checked against the DOI in this\
          header, and the values MUST be the same.\
\
     o    XID (4 octets) -- The transaction ID.  A KINK transaction is\
          bound together by a transaction ID, which is created by the\
          command initiator and replicated in subsequent messages in the\
          transaction.  A transaction is defined as a command, a reply,\
          and an optional acknowledgement.  Transaction IDs are used by\
          the initiator to discriminate between multiple outstanding\
          requests to a responder.  It is not used for replay protection\
          because that functionality is provided by Kerberos.  The value\
          of XID is chosen by the initiator and MUST be unique with all\
          outstanding transactions.  XIDs MAY be constructed by using a\
          monotonic counter or random number generator.\
\
     o    NextPayload (1 octet) -- Indicates the type of the first\
          payload after the message header.\
\
     o    A, or ACKREQ (1 bit) -- ACK Request.  Set to one if the\
          responder requires an explicit acknowledgement that a REPLY\
          was received.  An initiator MUST NOT set this flag, nor should\
          a responder except for a REPLY to a CREATE when the optimistic\
          proposal is chosen.\
\
     o    RESERVED2 (7 bits) -- Reserved and MUST be zero on send, MUST\
          be ignored by a receiver.\
\
     o    CksumLen (2 octets) -- CksumLen is the length in octets of the\
          cryptographic checksum of the message.  A CksumLen of zero\
          implies that the message is unauthenticated.\

\
\
     o    Cksum (variable) -- Kerberos keyed checksum over the entire\
          message excluding the Cksum field itself.  When any padding\
          bytes are required between the last payload and the Cksum\
          field, they MUST be included in the calculation.  This field\
          MUST always be present whenever a key is available via an\
          AP-REQ or AP-REP payload.  The key used MUST be the session\
          key in the ticket.  When a key is not available, this field is\
          not present, and the CksumLen field is set to zero.  The\
          content of this field is the output of the Kerberos 5 get_mic\
          function [KCRYPTO].  The get_mic function used is specified by\
          a checksum type, which is a "required checksum mechanism" of\
          the etype for the Kerberos session key in the Kerberos ticket.\
          If the checksum type is not a keyed algorithm, the message\
          MUST be rejected.\
\
          To compute the checksum, the CksumLen field is zeroed out and\
          the Length field is filled with the total packet length\
          without the checksum.  Then, the packet is passed to the\
          get_mic function and its output is appended to the packet.\
          Any KINK padding after the Cksum field is not allowed, except\
          the Kerberos internal one, which may be included in the output\
          of the get_mic function.  Finally, the CksumLen field is\
          filled with the checksum length and the Length field is filled\
          with the total packet length including the checksum.\
\
          To verify the checksum, a length-without-checksum is\
          calculated from the value of Length field, subtracting the\
          CksumLen.  The Length field is filled with the length-\
          without-checksum value and the CksumLen field is zeroed out.\
          Then, the packet without checksum (offset from 0 to length-\
          without-checksum minus 1 of the received packet) and the\
          checksum (offset from length-without-checksum to the last) are\
          passed to the verify_mic function.  If verification fails, the\
          message MUST be dropped.\
\
   The KINK header is followed immediately by a series of\
   Type/Length/Value fields, defined in section 4.2.\
\
4.1.  KINK Alignment Rules\
\
   KINK has the following rules regarding alignment and padding:\
\
     o    All length fields MUST reflect the actual number of octets in\
          the structure; i.e., they do not account for padding bytes\
          required by KINK alignments.\
\
     o    KINK headers, payloads, and the Cksum field MUST be aligned on\
          4-octet boundaries.\

\
\
     o    Variable length fields (except the Cksum field) MUST always\
          start immediately after the last octet of the previous field.\
          That is, they are not aligned to 4-octet boundaries.\
\
4.2.  KINK Payloads\
\
   Immediately following the header, there is a list of\
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) payloads.  There can be any number of\
   payloads following the header.  Each payload MUST begin with a\
   payload header.  Each payload header is built on the generic payload\
   header.  Any data immediately follows the generic header.  Payloads\
   are all implicitly aligned to 4-octet boundaries, though the payload\
   length field MUST accurately reflect the actual number of octets in\
   the payload.\

4.2.1.  KINK_AP_REQ Payload\
\
   The KINK_AP_REQ payload relays a Kerberos AP-REQ to the responder.\
   The AP-REQ MUST request mutual authentication.\
\
   This document does not specify how to generate the principal name.\
   That is, complete principal names may be stored in local policy,\
   Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) may be converted to principal\
   names, IP addresses may be converted to principal names by secure\
   name services, etc., but see the first paragraph of the Security\
   Considerations section.\
\
   If the peer's principal name for the KINK service is generated from\
   an FQDN, the principal name, which the initiator starts from, will be\
   "kink/fqdn@REALM"; where "kink" is a literal string for the KINK\
   IPsec service, "fqdn" is the fully qualified domain name of the\
   service host, and "REALM" is the Kerberos realm of the service.  A\
   principal name is case sensitive, and "fqdn" part MUST be lowercase\
   as described in [KERBEROS].\

4.2.3.  KINK_KRB_ERROR Payload\
\
   The KINK_KRB_ERROR payload relays Kerberos type errors back to the\
   initiator.  The initiator MUST be prepared to receive any valid\
   Kerberos error type [KERBEROS].\
\
   KINK implementations SHOULD make use of a KINK Cksum field when\
   returning KINK_KRB_ERROR and the appropriate service key is\
   available.  Especially in the case of clock skew errors, protecting\
   the error at the server creates a better user experience because it\
   does not require clocks to be synchronized.  However, many Kerberos\
   implementations do not make it easy to obtain the session key in\
   order to protect error packets.  For unauthenticated Kerberos errors,\
   the initiator MAY choose to act on them, but SHOULD take precautions\
   against make-work kinds of attacks.\
\
   Note that KINK does not make use of the text or e_data field of the\
   Kerberos error message, though a compliant KINK implementation MUST\
   be prepared to receive them and MAY log them.\
\
   The value field of this payload has the following format:\

          wants to communicate with.  It is assumed that the initiator\
          knows the responder's principal name (including the realm\
          name) in the same way as the non-User-to-User case.  The TGT\
          returned MUST NOT be an inter-realm TGT and its cname and\
          crealm MUST match the requested principal name, so that the\
          initiator can rendezvous with the responder at the responder's\
          realm.\
\
          PrincName values are octet string representations of a\
          principal and realm name formatted just like the octet string\
          used in the "NAME" component of Generic Security Service\
          Application Program Interface (GSS-API) [RFC2743] exported\
          name token for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC1964].\
          See RFC 1964, section 2.1.3.\
\
   If the responder is not the requested principal and is unable to get\
   a TGT for the name, it MAY return a KRB_AP_ERR_NOT_US.  If the\
   administrative policy prohibits returning a TGT, it MAY return a\
   KINK_U2UDENIED.\

          to 0.\
\
   The KINK_ISAKMP payload encapsulates the IKE Quick Mode (phase 2)\
   payloads to take the appropriate action dependent on the KINK\
   command.  There may be any number of KINK_ISAKMP payloads within a\
   single KINK message.  While [IKE] is somewhat fuzzy about whether\
   multiple different SAs may be created within a single IKE message,\
   KINK explicitly requires that a new ISAKMP header be used for each\
   discrete SA operation.  In other words, a KINK implementation MUST\
   NOT send multiple Quick Mode transactions within a single KINK_ISAKMP\
   payload.\
\
   The purpose of the Quick Mode version is to allow backward\
   compatibility with IKE and ISAKMP if there are subsequent revisions.\
   At the present time, the Quick Mode major and minor versions are set\
   to one and zero (1.0), respectively.  These versions do not\
   correspond to the ISAKMP version in the ISAKMP header.  A compliant\
   KINK implementation MUST support receipt of 1.0 payloads.  It MAY\
   support subsequent versions (both sending and receiving), and SHOULD\
   provide a means to resort back to Quick Mode version 1.0 if the KINK\
   peer is unable to process future versions.  A compliant KINK\
   implementation MUST NOT mix Quick Mode versions in any given\
   transaction.\
\
4.2.7.  KINK_ENCRYPT Payload\
\
   The KINK_ENCRYPT payload encapsulates other KINK payloads and is\
   encrypted using the session key and the algorithm specified by its\
   etype.  This payload MUST be the final one in the outer payload chain\
   of the message.  The KINK_ENCRYPT payload MUST be encrypted before\
   the final KINK checksum is applied.\

\
\
   Fields:\
\
     o    Next Payload, RESERVED, Payload Length -- Defined in the\
          beginning of this section.  This payload is the last one in a\
          message, and accordingly, the Next Payload field must be\
          KINK_DONE (0).\
\
     o    InnerNextPload -- First payload type of the inner series of\
          encrypted KINK payloads.\
\
     o    RESERVED2 -- Reserved and MUST be zero when sent, MUST be\
          ignored when received.\
\
   The coverage of the encrypted data begins at InnerNextPload so that\
   the first payload's type is kept confidential.  Thus, the number of\
   encrypted octets is PayloadLength - 4.\
\
   The format of the encryption payload follows the normal Kerberos\
   semantics.  Its content is the output of an encrypt function defined\
   in the Encryption Algorithm Profile section of [KCRYPTO].  Parameters\
   such as encrypt function itself, specific-key, and initial state are\
   defined with the etype.  The encrypt function may have padding in\
   itself and there may be some garbage data at the end of the decrypted\
   plaintext.  A KINK implementation MUST be prepared to ignore such\
   padding after the last sub-payload inside the KINK_ENCRYPT payload.\
   Note that each encrypt function has its own integrity protection\
   mechanism.  It is redundant with the checksum in the KINK header, but\
   this is unavoidable because it is not always possible to remove the\
   integrity protection part from the encrypt function.\
\
4.2.8.  KINK_ERROR Payload\
\
   The KINK_ERROR payload type provides a protocol-level mechanism of\
   returning an error condition.  This payload should not be used for\
   either Kerberos-generated errors or DOI-specific errors that have\
   their own payloads defined.  The error code is in network order.\

   The responder MUST NOT return KINK_OK.  When received, the initiator\
   MAY act as if the specific KINK_ERROR payload were not present.  If\
   the initiator supports multiple Quick Mode versions or DOIs,\
   KINK_BADQMVERS or KINK_INVDOI is received, and the Cksum is verified,\
   then it MAY retry with another version or DOI.  A responder SHOULD\
   return a KINK error with KINK_INVMAJ, when it receives an unsupported\
   KINK version number in the header.  When KINK_U2UDENIED is received,\
   the initiator MAY retry with the non-User-to-User mode (if it has not\
   yet been tried).\
\
   In general, the responder MAY choose to return these errors in reply\
   to unauthenticated commands, but SHOULD take care to avoid being\
   involved in denial of service attacks.  Similarly, the initiator MAY\

   avoid denial of service attacks.\

\
5.  Differences from IKE Quick Mode\
\
   KINK directly uses ISAKMP payloads to negotiate SAs.  In particular,\
   KINK uses IKE phase 2 payload types (aka Quick Mode).  In general,\
   there should be very few changes necessary to an IKE implementation\
   to establish the SAs, and unless there is a note to the contrary in\
   the memo, all capabilities and requirements in [IKE] MUST be\
   supported.  IKE phase 1 payloads MUST NOT be sent.\
\
   Unlike IKE, KINK defines specific commands for creation, deletion,\
   and status of SAs, mainly to facilitate predictable SA\
   creation/deletion (see sections 3.2 and 3.3).  As such, KINK places\
   certain restrictions on what payloads may be sent with which\
   commands, and some additional restrictions and semantics of some of\
   the payloads.  Implementors should refer to [IKE] and [ISAKMP] for\
   the actual format and semantics.  If a particular IKE phase 2 payload\
   is not mentioned here, it means that there are no differences in its\
   use.\
\
\
     o   The Security Association Payload header for IP is defined in\
         section 4.6.1 of [IPDOI].  For this memo, the Domain of\
         Interpretation MUST be set to 1 (IPsec) and the Situation\
         bitmap MUST be set to 1 (SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY).  All other fields\
         are omitted (because SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY is set).\
\
     o   KINK also expands the semantics of IKE in that it defines an\
         optimistic proposal for CREATE commands to allow SA creation to\
         complete in two messages.\
\
     o   IKE Quick Mode (phase 2) uses the hash algorithm used in main\
         mode (phase 1) to generate the keying material.  For this\
         purpose, KINK MUST use a pseudo-random function determined by\
         the etype of the session key.\
\
     o   KINK does not use the HASH payload at all.\
\
     o   KINK allows the Nonce payload Nr to be optional to facilitate\
         optimistic keying.\

\
5.1.  Security Association Payloads\
\
   KINK supports the following SA attributes from [IPDOI]:\
\
   class                     value           type\
   -------------------------------------------------\
   SA Life Type                1               B\

   Key Rounds                  7               B\
\
   Refer to [IPDOI] for the actual definitions of these attributes.\
\
5.2.  Proposal and Transform Payloads\
\
   KINK directly uses the Proposal and Transform payloads with no\
   differences.  KINK, however, places additional relevance to the first\
   proposal and first transform of each conjugate for optimistic keying.\
\
5.3.  Identification Payloads\
\
   The Identification payload carries information that is used to\
   identify the traffic that is to be protected by the SA that will be\
   established.  KINK restricts the ID types, which are defined in\
   section 4.6.2.1 of [IPDOI], to the following values:\
\
      ID Type                  Value\
      -------                  -----\
      ID_IPV4_ADDR               1\
      ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET        4\
      ID_IPV6_ADDR               5\
      ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET        6\
      ID_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE         7\
      ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE         8\
\
5.4.  Nonce Payloads\
\
   The Nonce payload contains random data that MUST be used in key\
   generation.  It MUST be sent by the initiating KINK peer, and MAY be\
   sent by the responding KINK peer.  See section 7 for the discussion\
   of its use in key generation.\

\
\
5.5.  Notify Payloads\
\
   Notify payloads are used to transmit several informational data, such\
   as error conditions and state transitions to a peer.  For example,\
   notification information transmit can be error messages specifying\
   why an SA could not be established.  It can also be status data that\
   a process managing an SA database wishes to communicate with a peer\
   process.\
\
   Types in the range 0 - 16383 are intended for reporting errors\
   [ISAKMP].  An implementation receiving a type in this range that it\
   does not recognize in a response MUST assume that the corresponding\
   request has failed entirely.  Unrecognized error types in a request\
   and status types in a request or response MUST be ignored, and they\
   SHOULD be logged.  Notify payloads with status types MAY be added to\
   any message and MUST be ignored if not recognized.  They are intended\
   to indicate capabilities, and as part of SA negotiation are used to\
   negotiate non-cryptographic parameters.\
\
   The table below lists the Notification messages and their\
   corresponding values.  PAYLOAD-MALFORMED denotes some error types\
   defined by [ISAKMP].  Hence INVALID-PROTOCOL-ID, for example, is not\
   used in this document.  INVALID-MAJOR-VERSION and INVALID-MINOR-\

\
\
   PAYLOAD-MALFORMED                        16\
\
      Sent if the KINK_ISAKMP payload received was invalid because\
      some type, length, or value was out of range.  It is also sent\
      when the request was rejected for reason that was not matched\
      with other error types.\
\
5.6.  Delete Payloads\
\
   KINK directly uses ISAKMP Delete payloads with no changes.\
\
5.7.  KE Payloads\
\
   IKE requires that perfect forward secrecy (PFS) be supported through\
   the use of the KE payload.  KINK retains the ability to use PFS, but\
   relaxes the requirement from must implement to SHOULD implement.  The\
   reasons are described in the Security Considerations section.\
\
6.  Message Construction and Constraints for IPsec DOI\
\
   All commands, responses, and acknowledgements are bound together by\
   the XID field of the message header.  The XID is normally a\
   monotonically incrementing field, and is used by the initiator to\
   differentiate between outstanding requests to a responder.  The XID\
   field does not provide replay protection as that functionality is\
   provided by the Kerberos mechanisms.  In addition, commands and\
   responses MUST use a cryptographic checksum over the entire message\
   if the two peers share a key via a ticket exchange.\
\
   In all cases in this section, if a message contains a KINK_AP_REQ or\
   KINK_AP_REP payload, other KINK payloads MAY be encapsulated in a\
   KINK_ENCRYPT payload.\
\
6.1.  REPLY Message\
\
   The REPLY message is a generic reply that MUST contain either a\
   KINK_AP_REP, a KINK_KRB_ERROR, or a KINK_ERROR payload.  REPLY\
   messages MAY contain additional DOI-specific payloads such as ISAKMP\
   payloads that are defined in the following sections.\
\
6.2.  ACK Message\
\
   ACKs are sent only when the ACKREQ bit is set in a REPLY message.  An\
   ACK message MUST contain an AP-REQ payload and no other payload.\

\
6.3.  CREATE Message\
\
   This message initiates an establishment of new security\
   association(s).  The CREATE message must contain an AP-REQ payload\
   and any DOI-specific payloads.\

   Replies are of the following forms:\

            [KE]\
            [IDci, IDcr]\
            [Notification Payloads]\
\
   Note that there MUST be at least a single proposal payload and a\
   single transform payload in REPLY messages.  There will be multiple\
   proposal payloads only when an SA bundle is negotiated.  Also: unlike\
   IKE, the Nonce payload Nr is not required, and if it exists, an\
   acknowledgement must be requested to indicate that the initiator's\
   outgoing SAs must be modified.  If any of the first proposals are not\
   chosen by the recipient, it SHOULD include the Nonce payload.\
\
   KINK, like IKE, allows the creation of many SAs in one create\
   command.  If any of the optimistic proposals are not chosen by the\
   responder, it MUST request an ACK.\
\
   If an IPsec DOI-specific error is encountered, the responder must\
   reply with a Notify payload describing the error:\

\
   Finally, if the responder finds a Kerberos or KINK type of error for\
   which it cannot create an AP-REP, it MUST reply with a lone\
   KINK_KRB_ERROR or KINK_ERROR payload:\

   REPLY KINK Header\
     [KINK_KRB_ERROR]\
     [KINK_ERROR]\
\
6.5.  STATUS Message\
\
   The STATUS command is used in two ways:\
\
     1)  As a means to relay an ISAKMP Notification message.\
\
     2)  As a means of probing a peer whether its epoch has changed for\
         dead peer detection.\
\
   STATUS contains the following payloads:\
     KINK Header\
     KINK_AP_REQ\
     [[KINK_ENCRYPT]\
        KINK_ISAKMP payload\
            [Notification Payloads]]\

   There are three forms of replies for a STATUS.  The normal form is:\

   reply with a lone KINK_KRB_ERROR or KINK_ERROR payload:\
\
   REPLY KINK Header\
     [KINK_KRB_ERROR]\
     [KINK_ERROR]\
\
6.6.  GETTGT Message\
\
   A GETTGT command is only used to carry a Kerberos TGT and is not\
   related to SA management; therefore, it contains only KINK_TGT_REQ\
   payload and does not contain any DOI-specific payload.\
\
   There are two forms of replies for a GETTGT.  In the normal form,\
   where the responder is allowed to return its TGT, the REPLY contains\
   KINK_TGT_REP payload.  If the responder is not allowed to return its\
   TGT, it MUST reply with a KINK_ERROR payload.\
\
7.  ISAKMP Key Derivation\
\
   KINK uses the same key derivation mechanisms defined in section 5.5\
   of [IKE], which is:\
\
   KEYMAT = prf(SKEYID_d, [g(qm)^xy |] protocol | SPI | Ni_b [| Nr_b])\
\
   The following differences apply:\
\
     o    prf is the pseudo-random function corresponding to the session\
          key's etype.  They are defined in [KCRYPTO].\
\
     o    SKEYID_d is the session key in the Kerberos service ticket\
          from the AP-REQ.  Note that subkeys are not used in KINK and\
          MUST be ignored if received.\
\
     o    Both Ni_b and Nr_b are the part of the Nonce payloads (Ni and\
          Nr, respectively) as described in section 3.2 of [IKE].  Nr_b\
          is optional, which means that Nr_b is treated as if a zero\
          length value was supplied when the responder's nonce (Nr) does\
          not exist.  When Nr exists, Nr_b MUST be included in the\
          calculation.\

RFC 4430                          KINK                        March 2006\
\
\
   Note that g(qm)^xy refers to the keying material generated when KE\
   payloads are supplied using Diffie-Hellman key agreement.  This is\
   explained in section 5.5 of [IKE].\
\
   The rest of the key derivation (e.g., how to expand KEYMAT) follows\
   IKE.  How to use derived keying materials is up to each service\
   (e.g., section 4.5.2 of [IPSEC]).\
\
8.  Key Usage Numbers for Kerberos Key Derivation\
\
   Kerberos encrypt/decrypt functions and get_mic/verify_mic functions\
   require "key usage numbers".  They are used to generate specific keys\
   for cryptographic operations so that different keys are used for\
   different purposes/objects.  KINK uses two usage numbers, listed\
   below.\
\
      Purpose                                   Usage number\
      -------                                   ------------\
      KINK_ENCRYPT payload (for encryption)      39\
      Cksum field (for checksum)                 40\
\
9.  Transport Considerations\
\
   KINK uses UDP on port 910 to transport its messages.  There is one\
   timer T which SHOULD take into consideration round-trip\
   considerations and MUST implement a truncated exponential back-off\
   mechanism.  The state machine is simple: any message that expects a\
   response MUST retransmit the request using timer T.  Since Kerberos\
   requires that messages be retransmitted with new times for replay\
   protection, the message MUST be re-created each time including the\
   checksum of the message.  Both commands and replies with the ACKREQ\
   bit set are kept on retransmit timers.  When a KINK initiator\
   receives a REPLY with the ACKREQ bit set, it MUST retain the ability\
   to regenerate the ACK message for the transaction for a minimum of\
   its full retransmission timeout cycle or until it notices that\
   packets have arrived on the newly constructed SA, whichever comes\
   first.\
\
   When a KINK peer retransmits a message, it MUST create a new Kerberos\
   authenticator for the AP-REQ so that the peer can differentiate\
   between replays and dropped packets.  This results in a potential\
   race condition when a retransmission occurs before an in-flight reply\
   is received/processed.  To counter this race condition, the\
   retransmitting party SHOULD keep a list of valid authenticators that\
   are outstanding for any particular transaction.\

RFC 4430                          KINK                        March 2006\
\
\
   When a KINK peer retransmits a command, it MUST use the same ticket\
   within the retransmissions.  This is to avoid race conditions on\
   using different keys, which result in different KEYMATs between an\
   initiator and a responder.  For this reason, (1) an initiator MUST\
   obtain a ticket whose lifetime is greater than the initiator's\
   maximum transaction time including timeouts, or (2) it MUST continue\
   to use the same ticket within a set of retransmissions, and iff it\
   receives an error (most likely KRB_AP_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED) from the\
   responder, it starts a new transaction with a new ticket.\
\
10.  Security Considerations\
\
   The principal names are the identities of the KINK services, but the\
   traffic protected by SAs are identified by DOI-specific selectors (IP\
   addresses, port numbers, etc.).  This may lead to a breakaway of\
   SA-protected data from authentication.  For example, if two different\
   hosts claim that they have the same IP address, it may be impossible\
   to predict which principal's key protects the data.  Thus, an\
   implementation must take care for the binding between principal names\
   and the SA selectors.\
\
   Sending errors without cryptographic protection must be handled very\
   carefully.  There is a trade-off between wanting to be helpful in\
   diagnosing a problem and wanting to avoid being a dupe in a denial of\
   service attack.\
\
   KINK cobbles together and reuses many parts of both Kerberos and IKE,\
   the latter which in turn is cobbled together from many other memos.\
   As such, KINK inherits many of the weaknesses and considerations of\
   each of its components.  However, KINK uses only IKE phase 2 payloads\
   to create and delete SAs; the security considerations which pertain\
   to IKE phase 1 may be safely ignored.  However, being able to ignore\
   IKE's authentication phase necessarily means that KINK inherits all\
   of the security considerations of Kerberos authentication as outlined\
   in [KERBEROS].  For one, a KDC, like an Authentication,\
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, is a point of attack and\
   all that implies.  Much has been written about various shortcomings\
   and mitigations of Kerberos, and they should be evaluated for any\
   deployment.\
\
   KINK's use of Kerberos presents a couple of considerations.  First,\
   KINK explicitly expects that the KDC will provide adequate entropy\
   when it generates session keys.  Second, Kerberos is used as a user\
   authentication protocol with the possibility of dictionary attacks on\
   user passwords.  This memo does not describe a particular method to\
   avoid these pitfalls, but recommends that suitable randomly generated\

\
\
   keys should be used for the service principals such as using the\
   -randomkey option with MIT's "kadmin addprinc" command as well as for\
   clients when that is practical.\
\
   Kerberos does not currently provide perfect forward secrecy in\
   general.  KINK with the KE payload can provide PFS for a service key\
   from a Kerberos key, but the KE is not mandatory because of the\
   computational cost.  This is a trade-off and operators can choose the\
   PFS over the cost, and vice versa.  KINK itself should be secure from\
   offline analysis from compromised principal passphrases if PFS is\
   used, but from an overall system's standpoint, the existence of other\
   Kerberized services that do not provide PFS makes this a less than\
   optimal situation.\
\
11.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The IANA has assigned a well-known port number for KINK.\
\
   The IANA has created a new registry for KINK parameters, and has\
   registered the following identifiers.\
\
      KINK Message Types (section 4)\
      KINK Next Payload Types (section 4.2)\
      KINK Error Codes (section 4.2.8)\
\
   Changes and additions to this registry follow the policies described\
   below.  Their meanings are described in [BCP26].\
\
     o    Using the numbers in the "Private Use" range is Private Use.\
\
     o    Assignment from the "RESERVED TO IANA" range needs Standards\
          Action, or non-standards-track RFCs with Expert Review.\
          (Though the full specification may be a public and permanent\
          document of a standards body other than IETF, an RFC referring\
          it is needed.)\
\
     o    Other change requires Standards Action.\
\
12.  Forward Compatibility Considerations\
\
   KINK can accommodate future versions of Quick Mode through the use of\
   the version field in the ISAKMP payload as well as new domains of\
   interpretation.  In this memo, the only supported Quick Mode version\
   is 1.0, which corresponds to [IKE].  Likewise, the only DOI supported\
   is the IPsec domain of interpretation [IPDOI].  New Quick Mode\
   versions and DOIs MUST be described in subsequent memos.\

RFC 4430                          KINK                        March 2006\
\
\
   KINK implementations MUST reject ISAKMP versions that are greater\
   than the highest currently supported version with a KINK_BADQMVERS\
   error type.  A KINK implementation that receives a KINK_BADQMVERS\
   message SHOULD be capable of reverting back to version 1.0.\
\
12.1.  New Versions of Quick Mode\
\
   The IPsec working group is defining the next-generation IKE protocol\
   [IKEv2], which does not use Quick Mode, but it is similar to the one\
   in IKEv1.  The difference between the two is summarized in Appendix A\
   of [IKEv2].  Each of them must be considered in order to use IKEv2\
   with KINK.\
\
12.2.  New DOI\
\
   The KINK message header contains a field called "Domain of\
   Interpretation (DOI)" to allow other domains of interpretation to use\
   KINK as a secure transport mechanism for keying.\
\
   As one example of a new DOI, the MSEC working group defined the Group\
   Domain of Interpretation [GDOI], which defines a few new messages,\
   which look like ISAKMP messages, but are not defined in ISAKMP.\
\
   In order to carry GDOI messages in KINK, the DOI field in the KINK\
   header would indicate that GDOI is being used, instead of IPSEC-DOI,\
   and the KINK_ISAKMP payload would contain the payloads defined in the\
   GDOI document rather than the payloads used by [IKE] Quick Mode.  The\
   version number in the KINK_ISAKMP header is related to the DOI in the\
   KINK header, so a maj.min version 1.0 under DOI GDOI is different\
   from a maj.min version 1.0 under DOI IPSEC-DOI.\
\
13.  Related Work\
\
   The IPsec working group has defined a number of protocols that\
   provide the ability to create and maintain cryptographically secure\
   SAs at layer three (i.e., the IP layer).  This effort has produced\
   two distinct protocols:\
\
     o    a mechanism for encrypting and authenticating IP datagram\
          payloads that assumes a shared secret between the sender and\
          receiver\
\
     o    a mechanism for IPsec peers to perform mutual authentication\
          and exchange keying material\
\
   The IPsec working group has defined a peer-to-peer authentication and\
   keying mechanism, IKE (RFC 2409).  One of the drawbacks of a peer-\
   to-peer protocol is that each peer must know and implement a site's\

\
\
   security policy, which in practice can be quite complex.  In\
   addition, the peer-to-peer nature of IKE requires the use of Diffie-\
   Hellman (DH) to establish a shared secret.  DH, unfortunately, is\
   computationally quite expensive and prone to denial of service\
   attacks.  IKE also relies on X.509 certificates to realize scalable\
   authentication of peers.  Digital signatures are also computationally\
   expensive, and certificate-based trust models are difficult to deploy\
   in practice.  While IKE does allow for a pre-shared key, key\
   distribution is required between all peers -- an O(n^2) problem --\
   which is problematic for large deployments.\

   and Matt Hur and David McGrew.  The inspiration for wholly reusing\
   IKE phase 2 is the result of Tero Kivinen's document suggesting\
   grafting Kerberos authentication onto Quick Mode.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This memo specifies an RTP payload format for the video coding\
   standard Video Codec 1, also known as VC-1.  The specification for\
   the VC-1 bit stream format and decoding process is published by the\
   Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) as SMPTE\
   421M [1].\
\
   VC-1 has a broad applicability, as it is suitable for low bit rate\
   Internet streaming applications to High Definition Television (HDTV)\
   broadcast and Digital Cinema applications with nearly lossless\
   coding.  The overall performance of VC-1 is such that bit rate\

\
\
   savings of more than 50% are reported [9] when compared with MPEG-2.\
   See [9] for further details about how VC-1 compares with other\
   codecs, such as MPEG-4 and H.264/AVC.  (In [9], VC-1 is referred to\
   by its earlier name, VC-9.)\
\
   VC-1 is widely used for downloading and streaming movies on the\
   Internet, in the form of Windows Media Video 9 (WMV-9) [9], because\
   the WMV-9 codec is compliant with the VC-1 standard.  VC-1 has also\
   recently been adopted as a mandatory compression format for the\
   high-definition DVD formats HD DVD and Blu-ray.\
\
   SMPTE 421M defines the VC-1 bit stream syntax and specifies\
   constraints that must be met by VC-1 conformant bit streams.  SMPTE\
   421M also specifies the complete process required to decode the bit\
   stream.  However, it does not specify the VC-1 compression algorithm,\
   thus allowing for different ways of implementing a VC-1 encoder.\
\
   The VC-1 bit stream syntax has three profiles.  Each profile has\
   specific bit stream syntax elements and algorithms associated with\
   it.  Depending on the application in which VC-1 is used, some\
   profiles may be more suitable than others.  For example, Simple\
   profile is designed for low bit rate Internet streaming and for\
   playback on devices that can only handle low-complexity decoding.\
   Advanced profile is designed for broadcast applications, such as\
   digital TV, HD DVD, or HDTV.  Advanced profile is the only VC-1\
   profile that supports interlaced video frames and non-square pixels.\
\
   Section 2 defines the abbreviations used in this document.  Section 3\
   provides a more detailed overview of VC-1.  Sections 4 and 5 define\
   the RTP payload format for VC-1, and section 6 defines the media type\
   and SDP parameters for VC-1.  See section 7 for security\
   considerations, and section 8 for congestion control requirements.\

2.  Definitions and Abbreviations\
\
   This document uses the definitions in SMPTE 421M [1].  For\
   convenience, the following terms from SMPTE 421M are restated here:\
\
   B-picture:\
         A picture that is coded using motion compensated prediction\
         from past and/or future reference fields or frames.  A\
         B-picture cannot be used for predicting any other picture.\

\
\
   BI-picture:\
         A B-picture that is coded using information only from itself.\
         A BI-picture cannot be used for predicting any other picture.\
\
   Bit-stream data unit (BDU):\
         A unit of the compressed data which may be parsed (i.e., syntax\
         decoded) independently of other information at the same\
         hierarchical level.  A BDU can be, for example, a sequence\
         layer header, an entry-point header, a frame, or a slice.\
\
   Encapsulated BDU (EBDU):\
         A BDU that has been encapsulated using the encapsulation\
         mechanism described in Annex E of SMPTE 421M [1], to prevent\
         emulation of the start code prefix in the bit stream.\
\
   Entry-point:\
         A point in the bit stream that offers random access.\
\
   frame:\
         A frame contains lines of spatial information of a video\
         signal.  For progressive video, these lines contain samples\
         starting from one time instant and continuing through\
         successive lines to the bottom of the frame.  For interlaced\
         video, a frame consists of two fields, a top field and a bottom\
         field.  One of these fields will commence one field period\
         later than the other.\
\
   interlace:\
         The property of frames where alternating lines of the frame\
         represent different instances in time.  In an interlaced frame,\
         one of the fields is meant to be displayed first.\
\
   I-picture:\
         A picture coded using information only from itself.\
\
   level:\
         A defined set of constraints on the values that may be taken by\
         the parameters (such as bit rate and buffer size) within a\
         particular profile.  A profile may contain one or more levels.\
\
   P-picture:\
         A picture that is coded using motion compensated prediction\
         from past reference fields or frames.\

\
\
   picture:\
         For progressive video, a picture is identical to a frame, while\
         for interlaced video, a picture may refer to a frame, or the\
         top field or the bottom field of the frame depending on the\
         context.\
\
   profile:\
         A defined subset of the syntax of VC-1 with a specific set of\
         coding tools, algorithms, and syntax associated with it.  There\
         are three VC-1 profiles: Simple, Main, and Advanced.\
\
   progressive:\
         The property of frames where all the samples of the frame\
         represent the same instance in time.\
\
   random access:\
         A random access point in the bit stream is defined by the\
         following guarantee: If decoding begins at this point, all\
         frames needed for display after this point will have no\
         decoding dependency on any data preceding this point, and they\
         are also present in the decoding sequence after this point.  A\
         random access point is also called an entry-point.\
\
   sequence:\
         A coded representation of a series of one or more pictures.  In\
         VC-1 Advanced profile, a sequence consists of a series of one\
         or more entry-point segments, where each entry-point segment\
         consists of a series of one or more pictures, and where the\
         first picture in each entry-point segment provides random\
         access.  In VC-1 Simple and Main profiles, the first picture in\
         each sequence is an I-picture.\
\
   slice:\
         A consecutive series of macroblock rows in a picture, which are\
         encoded as a single unit.\
\
   start codes (SC):\
         Unique 32-bit codes that are embedded in the coded bit stream\
         and identify the beginning of a BDU.  Start codes consist of a\
         unique three-byte Start Code Prefix (SCP), and a one-byte Start\
         Code Suffix (SCS).\
\
3.  Overview of VC-1\
\
   The VC-1 bit stream syntax consists of three profiles: Simple, Main,\
   and Advanced.  Simple profile is designed for low bit rates and for\
   low complexity applications, such as playback of media on personal\
   digital assistants.  The maximum bit rate supported by Simple profile\

\
RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   is 384 kbps.  Main profile targets high bit rate applications, such\
   as streaming and TV over IP.  Main profile supports B-pictures, which\
   provide improved compression efficiency at the cost of higher\
   complexity.\
\
   Certain features that can be used to achieve high compression\
   efficiency, such as non-square pixels and support for interlaced\
   pictures, are only included in Advanced profile.  The maximum bit\
   rate supported by the Advanced profile is 135 Mbps, making it\
   suitable for nearly lossless encoding of HDTV signals.\
\
   Only Advanced profile supports carrying user-data (meta-data) in-band\
   with the compressed bit stream.  The user-data can be used for closed\
   captioning support, for example.\
\
   Of the three profiles, only Advanced profile allows codec\
   configuration parameters, such as the picture aspect ratio, to be\
   changed through in-band signaling in the compressed bit stream.\
\
   For each of the profiles, a certain number of "levels" have been\
   defined.  Unlike a "profile", which implies a certain set of features\
   or syntax elements, a "level" is a set of constraints on the values\
   of parameters in a profile, such as the bit rate or buffer size.\
   VC-1 Simple profile has two levels, Main profile has three, and\
   Advanced profile has five.  See Annex D of SMPTE 421M [1] for a\
   detailed list of the profiles and levels.\
\
3.1.  VC-1 Bit Stream Layering Model\
\
   The VC-1 bit stream is defined as a hierarchy of layers.  This is\
   conceptually similar to the notion of a protocol stack of networking\
   protocols.  The outermost layer is called the sequence layer.  The\
   other layers are entry-point, picture, slice, macroblock, and block.\
\
   In Simple and Main profiles, a sequence in the sequence layer\
   consists of a series of one or more coded pictures.  In Advanced\
   profile, a sequence consists of one or more entry-point segments,\
   where each entry-point segment consists of a series of one or more\
   pictures, and where the first picture in each entry-point segment\
   provides random access.  A picture is decomposed into macroblocks.  A\
   slice comprises one or more contiguous rows of macroblocks.\
\
   The entry-point and slice layers are only present in Advanced\
   profile.  In Advanced profile, the start of each entry-point layer\
   segment indicates a random access point.  In Simple and Main\
   profiles, each I-picture is a random access point.\
\

\
RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   Each picture can be coded as an I-picture, P-picture, skipped\
   picture, BI-picture, or as a B-picture.  These terms are defined in\
   section 2 of this document and in section 4.12 of SMPTE 421M [1].\
\
3.2.  Bit-stream Data Units in Advanced Profile\
\
   In Advanced profile, each picture and slice is considered a Bit-\
   stream Data Unit (BDU).  A BDU is always byte-aligned and is defined\
   as a unit that can be parsed (i.e., syntax decoded) independently of\
   other information in the same layer.\
\
   The beginning of a BDU is signaled by an identifier called Start Code\
   (SC).  Sequence layer headers and entry-point headers are also BDUs\
   and thus can be easily identified by their Start Codes.  See Annex E\
   of SMPTE 421M [1] for a complete list of Start Codes.  Blocks and\
   macroblocks are not BDUs and thus do not have a Start Code and are\
   not necessarily byte-aligned.\
\
   The Start Code consists of four bytes.  The first three bytes are\
   0x00, 0x00 and 0x01.  The fourth byte is called the Start Code Suffix\
   (SCS) and it is used to indicate the type of BDU that follows the\
   Start Code.  For example, the SCS of a sequence layer header (0x0F)\
   is different from the SCS of an entry-point header (0x0E).  The Start\
   Code is always byte-aligned and is transmitted in network byte order.\
\
   To prevent accidental emulation of the Start Code in the coded bit\
   stream, SMPTE 421M defines an encapsulation mechanism that uses byte\
   stuffing.  A BDU that has been encapsulated by this mechanism is\
   referred to as an Encapsulated BDU, or EBDU.\
\
3.3.  Decoder Initialization Parameters\
\
   In VC-1 Advanced profile, the sequence layer header contains\
   parameters that are necessary to initialize the VC-1 decoder.\
\
   The parameters apply to all entry-point segments until the next\
   occurrence of a sequence layer header in the coded bit stream.\
\
   The parameters in the sequence layer header include the Advanced\
   profile level, the maximum dimensions of the coded frames, the aspect\
   ratio, interlace information, the frame rate and up to 31 leaky\
   bucket parameter sets for the Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD).\
\
   Section 6.1 of SMPTE 421M [1] provides the formal specification of\
   the sequence layer header.\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   A sequence layer header is not defined for VC-1 Simple and Main\
   profiles.  For these profiles, decoder initialization parameters MUST\
   be conveyed out-of-band.  The decoder initialization parameters for\
   Simple and Main profiles include the maximum dimensions of the coded\
   frames and a leaky bucket parameter set for the HRD.  Section 4.7\
   specifies how the parameters are conveyed by this RTP payload format.\
\
   Each leaky bucket parameter set for the HRD specifies a peak\
   transmission bit rate and a decoder buffer capacity.  The coded bit\
   stream is restricted by these parameters.  The HRD model does not\
   mandate buffering by the decoder.  Its purpose is to limit the\
   encoder's bit rate fluctuations according to a basic buffering model\
   so that the resources necessary to decode the bit stream are\
   predictable.  The HRD has a constant-delay mode and a variable-delay\
   mode.  The constant-delay mode is appropriate for broadcast and\
   streaming applications, while the variable-delay mode is designed for\
   video-conferencing applications.\
\
   Annex C of SMPTE 421M [1] specifies the usage of the hypothetical\
   reference decoder for VC-1 bit streams.  A general description of the\
   theory of the HRD can be found in [10].\
\
   For Simple and Main profiles, the current buffer fullness value for\
   the HRD leaky bucket is signaled using the BF syntax element in the\
   picture header of I-pictures and BI-pictures.\
\
   For Advanced profile, the entry-point header specifies current buffer\
   fullness values for the leaky buckets in the HRD.  The entry-point\
   header also specifies coding control parameters that are in effect\
   until the occurrence of the next entry-point header in the bit\
   stream.  The concept of an entry-point layer applies only to VC-1\
   Advanced profile.  See Section 6.2 of SMPTE 421M [1] for the formal\
   specification of the entry-point header.\
\
3.4.  Ordering of Frames\
\
   Frames are transmitted in the same order in which they are captured,\
   except if B-pictures or BI-pictures are present in the coded bit\
   stream.  A BI-picture is a special kind of B-picture, and in the\
   remainder of this section the terms B-picture and B-frame also apply\
   to BI-pictures and BI-frames, respectively.\
\
   When B-pictures are present in the coded bit stream, the frames are\
   transmitted such that the frames that the B-pictures depend on are\
   transmitted first.  This is referred to as the coded order of the\
   frames.\
\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   The rules for how a decoder converts frames from the coded order to\
   the display order are stated in section 5.4 of SMPTE 421M [1].  In\
   short, if B-pictures may be present in the coded bit stream, a\
   hypothetical decoder implementation needs to buffer one additional\
   decoded frame.  When an I-frame or a P-frame is received, the frame\
   can be decoded immediately but it is not displayed until the next I-\
   or P-frame is received.  However, B-frames are displayed immediately.\
\
   Figure 1 illustrates the timing relationship between the capture of\
   frames, their coded order, and the display order of the decoded\
   frames, when B-pictures are present in the coded bit stream.  The\
   figure shows that the display of frame P4 is delayed until frame P7\
   is received, while frames B2 and B3 are displayed immediately.\
\

\
      Figure 1.  Frame reordering when B-pictures are present\
\
   If B-pictures are not present, the coded order and the display order\
   are identical, and frames can then be displayed without the\
   additional delay shown in Figure 1.\
\
4.  Encapsulation of VC-1 Format Bit Streams in RTP\
\
4.1.  Access Units\
\
   Each RTP packet contains an integral number of application data units\
   (ADUs).  For VC-1 format bit streams, an ADU is equivalent to one\
   Access Unit (AU).  An Access Unit is defined as the AU header\
   (defined in section 5.2) followed by a variable length payload, with\
   the rules and constraints described in sections 4.1 and 4.2.  Figure\
   2 shows the layout of an RTP packet with multiple AUs.\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   Each Access Unit MUST start with the AU header defined in section\
   5.2.  The AU payload MUST contain data belonging to exactly one VC-1\
   frame.  This means that data from different VC-1 frames will always\
   be in different AUs.  However, it possible for a single VC-1 frame to\
   be fragmented across multiple AUs (see section 4.2).\
\
   In the case of interlaced video, a VC-1 frame consists of two fields\
   that may be coded as separate pictures.  The two pictures still\
   belong to the same VC-1 frame.\
\
   The following rules apply to the contents of each AU payload when\
   VC-1 Advanced profile is used:\
\
   -  The AU payload MUST contain VC-1 bit stream data in EBDU format\
      (i.e., the bit stream must use the byte-stuffing encapsulation\
      mode defined in Annex E of SMPTE 421M [1].)\
\
   -  The AU payload MAY contain multiple EBDUs, e.g., a sequence layer\
      header, an entry-point header, a frame (picture) header, a field\
      header, and multiple slices and the associated user-data.\
      However, all slices and their corresponding macroblocks MUST\
      belong to the same video frame.\
\
   -  The AU payload MUST start at an EBDU boundary, except when the AU\
      payload contains a fragmented frame, in which case the rules in\
      section 4.2 apply.\
\
   When VC-1 Simple or Main profiles are used, the AU payload MUST start\
   at the beginning of a frame, except when the AU payload contains a\
   fragmented frame.  Section 4.2 describes how to handle fragmented\
   frames.\
\
   Access Units MUST be byte-aligned.  If the data in an AU (EBDUs in\
   the case of Advanced profile and frame in the case of Simple and\
   Main) does not end at an octet boundary, up to 7 zero-valued padding\
   bits MUST be added to achieve octet-alignment.\
\
4.2.  Fragmentation of VC-1 frames\
\
   Each AU payload SHOULD contain a complete VC-1 frame.  However, if\
   this would cause the RTP packet to exceed the MTU size, the frame\
   SHOULD be fragmented into multiple AUs to avoid IP-level\
   fragmentation.  When an AU contains a fragmented frame, this MUST be\
   indicated by setting the FRAG field in the AU header as defined in\
   section 5.3.\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   AU payloads that do not contain a fragmented frame or that contain\
   the first fragment of a frame MUST start at an EBDU boundary if\
   Advanced profile is used.  In this case, for Simple and Main\
   profiles, the AU payload MUST start at the beginning of a frame.\
\
   If Advanced profile is used, AU payloads that contain a fragment of a\
   frame other than the first fragment SHOULD start at an EBDU boundary,\
   such as at the start of a slice.\
\
   However, slices are only defined for Advanced profile, and are not\
   always used.  Blocks and macroblocks are not BDUs (have no Start\
   Code) and are not byte-aligned.  Therefore, it may not always be\
   possible to continue a fragmented frame at an EBDU boundary.  One can\
   determine if an AU payload starts at an EBDU boundary by inspecting\
   the first three bytes of the AU payload.  The AU payload starts at an\
   EBDU boundary if the first three bytes are identical to the Start\
   Code Prefix (i.e., 0x00, 0x00, 0x01).\
\
   In the case of Simple and Main profiles, since the blocks and\
   macroblocks are not byte-aligned, the fragmentation boundary may be\
   chosen arbitrarily.\
\
   If an RTP packet contains an AU with the last fragment of a frame,\
   additional AUs SHOULD NOT be included in the RTP packet.\
\
   If the PTS Delta field in the AU header is present, each fragment of\
   a frame MUST have the same presentation time.  If the DTS Delta field\
   in the AU header is present, each fragment of a frame MUST have the\
   same decode time.\
\
4.3.  Time Stamp Considerations\
\
   VC-1 video frames MUST be transmitted in the coded order.  A coded\
   order implies that no frames are dependent on subsequent frames, as\
   discussed in section 3.4.  When a video frame consists of a single\
   picture, the presentation time of the frame is identical to the\
   presentation time of the picture.  When the VC-1 interlace coding\
   mode is used, frames may contain two pictures, one for each field.\
   In that case, the presentation time of a frame is the presentation\
   time of the field that is displayed first.\
\
   The RTP timestamp field MUST be set to the presentation time of the\
   video frame contained in the first AU in the RTP packet.  The\
   presentation time can be used as the timestamp field in the RTP\
   header because it differs from the sampling instant of the frame only\
   by an arbitrary constant offset.\
\
\
\
\
\
Klemets                     Standards Track                    [Page 11]\
\
RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   If the video frame in an AU has a presentation time that differs from\
   the RTP timestamp field, then the presentation time MUST be specified\
   using the PTS Delta field in the AU header.  Since the RTP timestamp\
   field must be identical to the presentation time of the first video\
   frame, this can only happen if an RTP packet contains multiple AUs.\
   The syntax of the PTS Delta field is defined in section 5.2.\
\
   The decode time of a VC-1 frame is always monotonically increasing\
   when the video frames are transmitted in the coded order.  If neither\
   B- nor BI-pictures are present in the coded bit stream, then the\
   decode time of a frame SHALL be equal to the presentation time of the\
   frame.  A BI-picture is a special kind of B-picture, and in the\
   remainder of this section the terms B-picture and B-frame also apply\
   to BI-pictures and BI-frames, respectively.\
\
   If B-pictures may be present in the coded bit stream, then the decode\
   times of frames are determined as follows:\
\
   -  B-frames:\
      The decode time SHALL be equal to the presentation time of the\
      B-frame.\
\
   -  First non-B frame in the coded order:\
      The decode time SHALL be at least one frame period less than the\
      decode time of the next frame in the coded order.  A frame period\
      is defined as the inverse of the frame rate used in the coded bit\
      stream (e.g., 100 milliseconds if the frame rate is 10 frames per\
      seconds.)  For bit streams with a variable frame rate, the maximum\
      frame rate SHALL determine the frame period.  If the maximum frame\
      is not specified, the maximum frame rate allowed by the profile\
      and level SHALL be used.\
\
   -  Non-B frames (other than the first frame in the coded order):\
      The decode time SHALL be equal to the presentation time of the\
      previous non-B frame in the coded order.\
\
   As an example, consider Figure 1 in section 3.4.  To determine the\
   decode time of the first frame, I0, one must first determine the\
   decode time of the next frame, P1.  Because P1 is a non-B frame, its\
   decode time is equal to the presentation time of I0, which is 3 time\
   units.  Thus, the decode time of I0 must be at least one frame period\
   less than 3.  In this example, the frame period is 1, because one\
   frame is displayed every time unit.  Consequently, the decode time of\
   I0 is chosen as 2 time units.  The decode time of the third frame in\
   the coded order, P4, is 4, because it must be equal to the\
   presentation time of the previous non-B frame in the coded order, P1.\
   On the other hand, the decode time of B-frame B2 is 5 time units,\
   which is identical to its presentation time.\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   If the decode time of a video frame differs from its presentation\
   time, then the decode time MUST be specified using the DTS Delta\
   field in the AU header.  The syntax of the DTS Delta field is defined\
   in section 5.2.\
\
   Receivers are not required to use the DTS Delta field.  However,\
   possible uses include buffer management and pacing of frames prior to\
   decoding.  If RTP packets are lost, it is possible to use the DTS\
   Delta field to determine if the sequence of lost RTP packets\
   contained reference frames or only B-frames.  This can be done by\
   comparing the decode and presentation times of the first frame\
   received after the lost sequence against the presentation time of the\
   last reference frame received prior to the lost sequence.\
\
   Knowing if the stream will contain B-pictures may help the receiver\
   allocate resources more efficiently and can reduce delay, as an\
   absence of B-pictures in the stream implies that no reordering of\
   frames will be needed between the decoding process and the display of\
   the decoded frames.  This may be important for interactive\
   applications.\
\
   The receiver SHALL assume that the coded bit stream may contain\
   B-pictures in the following cases:\
\
   -  Advanced profile:\
      If the value of the "bpic" media type parameter defined in section\
      6.1 is 1, or if the "bpic" parameter is not specified.\
\
   -  Main profile:\
      If the MAXBFRAMES field in STRUCT_C decoder initialization\
      parameter has a non-zero value.  STRUCT_C is conveyed in the\
      "config" media type parameter, which is defined in section 6.1.\
\
   Simple profile does not use B-pictures.\
\
4.4.  Random Access Points\
\
   The entry-point header contains information that is needed by the\
   decoder to decode the frames in that entry-point segment.  This means\
   that in the event of lost RTP packets, the decoder may be unable to\
   decode frames until the next entry-point header is received.\
\
   The first frame after an entry-point header is a random access point\
   into the coded bit stream.  Simple and Main profiles do not have\
   entry-point headers, so for those profiles, each I-picture is a\
   random access point.\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   To allow the RTP receiver to detect that an RTP packet that was lost\
   contained a random access point, this RTP payload format defines a\
   field called "RA Count".  This field is present in every AU, and its\
   value is incremented (modulo 256) for every random access point.  For\
   additional details, see the definition of "RA Count" in section 5.2.\
\
   To make it easy to determine if an AU contains a random access point,\
   this RTP payload format also defines a bit called the "RA" flag in\
   the AU Control field.  This bit is set to 1 only on those AU's that\
   contain a random access point.  The RA bit is defined in section 5.3.\
\
4.5.  Removal of HRD Parameters\
\
   The sequence layer header of Advanced profile may include up to 31\
   leaky bucket parameter sets for the Hypothetical Reference Decoder\
   (HRD).  Each leaky bucket parameter set specifies a possible peak\
   transmission bit rate (HRD_RATE) and a decoder buffer capacity\
   (HRD_BUFFER).  See section 3.3 for additional discussion about the\
   HRD.\
\
   If the actual peak transmission rate is known by the RTP sender, the\
   RTP sender MAY remove all leaky bucket parameter sets except for the\
   one corresponding to the actual peak transmission rate.\
\
   For each leaky bucket parameter set in the sequence layer header,\
   there is also a parameter in the entry-point header that specifies\
   the initial fullness (HRD_FULL) of the leaky bucket.\
\
   If the RTP sender has removed any leaky bucket parameter sets from\
   the sequence layer header, then for any removed leaky bucket\
   parameter set, it MUST also remove the corresponding HRD_FULL\
   parameter in the entry-point header.\
\
   Removing leaky bucket parameter sets, as described above, may\
   significantly reduce the size of the sequence layer headers and the\
   entry-point headers.\
\
4.6.  Repeating the Sequence Layer Header\
\
   To improve robustness against loss of RTP packets, it is RECOMMENDED\
   that if the sequence layer header changes, it should be repeated\
   frequently in the bit stream.  In this case, it is RECOMMENDED that\
   the number of leaky bucket parameters in the sequence layer header\
   and the entry-point headers be reduced to one, as described in\
   section 4.5.  This will help reduce the overhead caused by repeating\
   the sequence layer header.\

\
RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   Any data in the VC-1 bit stream, including repeated copies of the\
   sequence header itself, must be accounted for when computing the\
   leaky bucket parameter for the HRD.  See section 3.3 for a discussion\
   about the HRD.\
\
   If the value of TFCNTRFLAG in the sequence layer header is 1, each\
   picture header contains a frame counter field (TFCNTR).  Each time\
   the sequence layer header is inserted in the bit stream, the value of\
   this counter MUST be reset.\
\
   To allow the RTP receiver to detect that an RTP packet that was lost\
   contained a new sequence layer header, the AU Control field defines a\
   bit called the "SL" flag.  This bit is toggled when a sequence layer\
   header is transmitted, but only if that header is different from the\
   most recently transmitted sequence layer header.  The SL bit is\
   defined in section 5.3.\
\
4.7.  Signaling of Media Type Parameters\
\
   When this RTP payload format is used with SDP, the decoder\
   initialization parameters described in section 3.3 MUST be signaled\
   in SDP using the media type parameters specified in section 6.1.\
   Section 6.2 specifies how to map the media type parameters to SDP\
   [5], section 6.3 defines rules specific to the SDP Offer/Answer\
   model, and section 6.4 defines rules for when SDP is used in a\
   declarative style.\
\
   When Simple or Main profiles are used, it is not possible to change\
   the decoder initialization parameters through the coded bit stream.\
   Any changes to the decoder initialization parameters would have to be\
   done through out-of-band means, e.g., by a SIP [14] re-invite or\
   similar means that convey an updated session description.\
\
   When Advanced profile is used, the decoder initialization parameters\
   MAY be changed by inserting a new sequence layer header or an entry-\
   point header in the coded bit stream.\
\
   The sequence layer header specifies the VC-1 level, the maximum size\
   of the coded frames and optionally also the maximum frame rate.  The\
   media type parameters "level", "width", "height", and "framerate"\
   specify upper limits for these parameters.  Thus, the sequence layer\
   header MAY specify values that are lower than the values of the media\
   type parameters "level", "width", "height", or "framerate", but the\
   sequence layer header MUST NOT exceed the values of any of these\
   media type parameters.\

\
\
4.8.  The "mode=1" Media Type Parameter\
\
   In certain applications using Advanced profile, the sequence layer\
   header never changes.  This MAY be signaled with the media type\
   parameter "mode=1".  (The "mode" parameter is defined in section\
   6.1.)  The "mode=1" parameter serves as a "hint" to the RTP receiver\
   that all sequence layer headers in the bit stream will be identical.\
   If "mode=1" is signaled and a sequence layer header is present in the\
   coded bit stream, then it MUST be identical to the sequence layer\
   header specified by the "config" media type parameter.\
\
   Since the sequence layer header never changes in "mode=1", the RTP\
   sender MAY remove it from the bit stream.  Note, however, that if the\
   value of TFCNTRFLAG in the sequence layer header is 1, each picture\
   header contains a frame counter field (TFCNTR).  This field is reset\
   each time the sequence layer header occurs in the bit stream.  If the\
   RTP sender chooses to remove the sequence layer header, then it MUST\
   ensure that the resulting bit stream is still compliant with the VC-1\
   specification (e.g., by adjusting the TFCNTR field, if necessary.)\
\
4.9.  The "mode=3" Media Type Parameter\
\
   In certain applications using Advanced profile, both the sequence\
   layer header and the entry-point header never change.  This MAY be\
   signaled with the media type parameter "mode=3".  The same rules\
   apply to "mode=3" as for "mode=1", described in section 4.8.\
   Additionally, if "mode=3" is signaled, then the RTP sender MAY\
   "compress" the coded bit stream by not including sequence layer\
   headers and entry-point headers in the RTP packets.\
\
   The RTP receiver MUST "decompress" the coded bit stream by\
   re-inserting the entry-point headers prior to delivering the coded\
   bit stream to the VC-1 decoder.  The sequence layer header does not\
   need to be decompressed by the receiver, as it never changes.\
\
   If "mode=3" is signaled and the RTP receiver receives a complete AU\
   or the first fragment of an AU, and the RA bit is set to 1 but the AU\
   does not begin with an entry-point header, then this indicates that\
   the entry-point header has been "compressed".  In that case, the RTP\
   receiver MUST insert an entry-point header at the beginning of the\
   AU.  When inserting the entry-point header, the RTP receiver MUST use\
   the one that was specified by the "config" media type parameter.\

                Figure 3.  RTP header according to RFC 3550\
\
   The fields of the fixed RTP header have their usual meaning, which is\
   defined in RFC 3550 and by the RTP profile in use, with the following\
   additional notes:\
\
   Marker bit (M): 1 bit\
         This bit is set to 1 if the RTP packet contains an Access Unit\
         containing a complete VC-1 frame or the last fragment of a VC-1\
         frame.\
\
   Payload type (PT): 7 bits\
         This document does not assign an RTP payload type for this RTP\
         payload format.  The assignment of a payload type has to be\
         performed either through the RTP profile used or in a dynamic\
         way.\
\
   Sequence Number: 16 bits\
         The RTP receiver can use the sequence number field to recover\
         the coded order of the VC-1 frames.  A typical VC-1 decoder\
         will require the VC-1 frames to be delivered in coded order.\
         When VC-1 frames have been fragmented across RTP packets, the\
         RTP receiver can use the sequence number field to ensure that\
         no fragment is missing.\

\
\
   Timestamp: 32 bits\
         The RTP timestamp is set to the presentation time of the VC-1\
         frame in the first Access Unit.  A clock rate of 90 kHz MUST be\
         used.\
\
5.2.  AU Header Syntax\
\
   The Access Unit header consists of a one-byte AU Control field, the\
   RA Count field, and 3 optional fields.  All fields MUST be written in\
   network byte order.  The structure of the AU header is illustrated in\
   Figure 4.\

\
                  Figure 4.  Structure of AU header\
\
   AU Control: 8 bits\
         The usage of the AU Control field is defined in section 5.3.\
\
   RA Count: 8 bits\
         Random Access Point Counter.  This field is a binary modulo 256\
         counter.  The value of this field MUST be incremented by 1 each\
         time an AU is transmitted where the RA bit in the AU Control\
         field is set to 1.  The initial value of this field is\
         undefined and MAY be chosen randomly.\
\
   AUP Len: 16 bits\
         Access Unit Payload Length.  Specifies the size, in bytes, of\
         the payload of the Access Unit.  The field does not include the\
         size of the AU header itself.  The field MUST be included in\
         each AU header in an RTP packet, except for the last AU header\
         in the packet.  If this field is not included, the payload of\
         the Access Unit SHALL be assumed to extend to the end of the\
         RTP payload.\
\
   PTS Delta: 32 bits\
         Presentation time delta.  Specifies the presentation time of\
         the frame as a 2's complement offset (delta) from the timestamp\
         field in the RTP header of this RTP packet.  The PTS Delta\
         field MUST use the same clock rate as the timestamp field in\
         the RTP header.\
\
         This field SHOULD NOT be included in the first AU header in the\
         RTP packet, because the RTP timestamp field specifies the\
         presentation time of the frame in the first AU.  If this field\

\
\
         is not included, the presentation time of the frame SHALL be\
         assumed to be specified by the timestamp field in the RTP\
         header.\
\
   DTS Delta: 32 bits\
         Decode time delta.  Specifies the decode time of the frame as a\
         2's complement offset (delta) between the presentation time and\
         the decode time.  Note that if the presentation time is larger\
         than the decode time, this results in a value for the DTS Delta\
         field that is greater than zero.  The DTS Delta field MUST use\
         the same clock rate as the timestamp field in the RTP header.\
         If this field is not included, the decode time of the frame\
         SHALL be assumed to be identical to the presentation time of\
         the frame.\
\
5.3.  AU Control Field Syntax\

   The structure of the 8-bit AU Control field is shown in Figure 5.\

\
      FRAG: 2 bits\
         Fragmentation Information.  This field indicates if the AU\
         payload contains a complete frame or a fragment of a frame.  It\
         MUST be set as follows:\
\
         0: The AU payload contains a fragment of a frame other than the\
            first or last fragment.\
         1: The AU payload contains the first fragment of a frame.\
         2: The AU payload contains the last fragment of a frame.\
         3: The AU payload contains a complete frame (not fragmented.)\
\
   RA: 1 bit\
         Random Access Point indicator.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if\
         the AU contains a frame that is a random access point.  In the\
         case of Simple and Main profiles, any I-picture is a random\
         access point.\
\
         In the case of Advanced profile, the first frame after an\
         entry-point header is a random access point.\

\
\
         If entry-point headers are not transmitted at every random\
         access point, this MUST be indicated using the media type\
         parameter "mode=3".\
\
   SL: 1 bit\
         Sequence Layer Counter.  This bit MUST be toggled, i.e.,\
         changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, if the AU contains a\
         sequence layer header and if it is different from the most\
         recently transmitted sequence layer header.  Otherwise, the\
         value of this bit must be identical to the value of the SL bit\
         in the previous AU.\
\
         The initial value of this bit is undefined and MAY be chosen\
         randomly.\
\
         The bit MUST be 0 for Simple and Main profile bit streams or if\
         the sequence layer header never changes.\
\
   LP: 1 bit\
         Length Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU header\
         includes the AUP Len field.\
\
   PT: 1 bit\
         PTS Delta Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU header\
         includes the PTS Delta field.\
\
   DT: 1 bit\
         DTS Delta Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU header\
         includes the DTS Delta field.\
\
   R: 1 bit\
         Reserved.  This bit MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored by\
         receivers.\

\
\
   Required parameters:\
\
         profile:\
            The value is an integer identifying the VC-1 profile.  The\
            following values are defined:\
\
            0: Simple profile\
            1: Main profile\
            3: Advanced profile\
\
            If the profile parameter is used to indicate properties of a\
            coded bit stream, it indicates the VC-1 profile that a\
            decoder has to support when it decodes the bit stream.\
\
            If the profile parameter is used for capability exchange or\
            in a session setup procedure, it indicates the VC-1 profile\
            that the codec supports.\
\
            level:\
            The value is an integer that specifies the level of the VC-1\
            profile.\
\
            For Advanced profile, valid values are 0 through 4, which\
            correspond to levels L0 through L4, respectively.  For\
            Simple and Main profiles, the following values are defined:\
\
            1: Low Level\
            2: Medium Level\
            3: High Level (only valid for Main profile)\
\
            If the level parameter is used to indicate properties of a\
            coded bit stream, it indicates the highest level of the VC-1\
            profile that a decoder has to support when it decodes the\
            bit stream.  Note that support for a level implies support\
            for all numerically lower levels of the given profile.\
\
            If the level parameter is used for capability exchange or in\
            a session setup procedure, it indicates the highest level of\
            the VC-1 profile that the codec supports.  See section 6.3\
            of RFC 4425 for specific rules for how this parameter is\
            used with the SDP Offer/Answer model.\

\
\
   Optional parameters:\
\
         config:\
            The value is a base16 [6] (hexadecimal) representation of an\
            octet string that expresses the decoder initialization\
            parameters.  Decoder initialization parameters are mapped\
            onto the base16 octet string in an MSB-first basis.  The\
            first bit of the decoder initialization parameters MUST be\
            located at the MSB of the first octet.  If the decoder\
            initialization parameters are not multiples of 8 bits, up to\
            7 zero-valued padding bits MUST be added in the last octet\
            to achieve octet alignment.\
\
            For Simple and Main profiles, the decoder initialization\
            parameters are STRUCT_C, as defined in Annex J of SMPTE 421M\
            [1].\
\
            For Advanced profile, the decoder initialization parameters\
            are a sequence layer header directly followed by an entry-\
            point header.  The two headers MUST be in EBDU format,\
            meaning that they must include their Start Codes and must\
            use the encapsulation method defined in Annex E of SMPTE\
            421M [1].\
\
         width:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying the\
            maximum horizontal size of the coded frames, in luma samples\
            (pixels in the luma picture).\
\
            For Simple and Main profiles, the value SHALL be identical\
            to the actual horizontal size of the coded frames.\
\
            For Advanced profile, the value SHALL be greater than, or\
            equal to, the largest horizontal size of the coded frames.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum horizontal size allowed by the specified profile and\
            level.\
\
         height:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying the\
            maximum vertical size of the coded frames, in luma samples\
            (pixels in a progressively coded luma picture).\
\
            For Simple and Main profiles, the value SHALL be identical\
            to the actual vertical size of the coded frames.\

\
         bitrate:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying the\
            peak transmission rate of the coded bit stream in bits per\
            second.  The number does not include the overhead caused by\
            RTP encapsulation, i.e., it does not include the AU headers,\
            or any of the RTP, UDP, or IP headers.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum bit rate allowed by the specified profile and level.\
            See the values for "RMax" in Annex D of SMPTE 421M [1].\
\
         buffer:\
            The value is an integer specifying the leaky bucket size, B,\
            in milliseconds, required to contain a stream transmitted at\
            the transmission rate specified by the bitrate parameter.\
            This parameter is defined in the hypothetical reference\
            decoder model for VC-1, in Annex C of SMPTE 421M [1].\
\
            Note that this parameter relates to the codec bit stream\
            only, and does not account for any buffering time that may\
            be required to compensate for jitter in the network.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum buffer size allowed by the specified profile and\
            level.  See the values for "BMax" and "RMax" in Annex D of\
            SMPTE 421M [1].\
\
         framerate:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying the\
            maximum number of frames per second in the coded bit stream,\
            multiplied by 1000 and rounded to the nearest integer value.\
            For example, 30000/1001 (approximately 29.97) frames per\
            second is represented as 29970.\
\
            This parameter can be used to control resource allocation at\
            the receiver.  For example, a receiver may choose to perform\
            additional post-processing on decoded frames only if the\
            frame rate is expected to be low.  The parameter MUST NOT be\
            used for pacing of the rendering process, since the actual\
            frame rate may differ from the specified value.\

            level.\
\
         bpic:\
            This parameter signals that B- and BI-pictures may be\
            present when Advanced profile is used.  If this parameter is\
            present, and B- or BI-pictures may be present in the coded\
            bit stream, this parameter MUST be equal to 1.\
\
            A value of 0 indicates that B- and BI-pictures SHALL NOT be\
            present in the coded bit stream, even if the sequence layer\
            header changes.  Inclusion of this parameter with a value of\
            0 is RECOMMENDED, if neither B- nor BI-pictures are included\
            in the coded bit stream.\
\
            This parameter MUST NOT be used with Simple and Main\
            profiles. For Main profile, the presence of B- and\
            BI-pictures is indicated by the MAXBFRAMES field in STRUCT_C\
            decoder initialization parameter.\
\
            For Advanced profile, if this parameter is not specified, a\
            value of 1 SHALL be assumed.\
\
         mode:\
            The value is an integer specifying the use of the sequence\
            layer header and the entry-point header.  This parameter is\
            only defined for Advanced profile.  The following values are\
            defined:\
\
            0: Both the sequence layer header and the entry-point header\
               may change, and changed headers will be included in the\
               RTP packets.\
            1: The sequence layer header specified in the config\
               parameter never changes.  The rules in section 4.8 of RFC\
               4425 MUST be followed.\
            3: The sequence layer header and the entry-point header\
               specified in the config parameter never change.  The\
               rules in section 4.9 of RFC 4425 MUST be followed.\

\
            preferred values for the "width", "height", "bitrate",\
            "buffer", and "framerate" parameters.  Section 6.3 of RFC\
            4425 provides specific rules for how these parameters are\
            used with the SDP Offer/Answer model.\
\
            Receivers that signal support for a given profile and level\
            MUST support the maximum values for these parameters for\
            that profile and level.  For example, a receiver that\
            indicates support for Main profile, Low level, must support\
            a width of 352 luma samples and a height of 288 luma\
            samples, even if this requires scaling the image to fit the\
            resolution of a smaller display device.\
\
            A receiver MAY use any of the max-width, max-height, max-\
            bitrate, max-buffer, and max-framerate parameters to\
            indicate preferred capabilities.  For example, a receiver\
            may choose to specify values for max-width and max-height\
            that match the resolution of its display device, since a bit\
            stream encoded using those parameters would not need to be\
            rescaled.\
\
            If any of the max-width, max-height, max-bitrate, max-\
            buffer, and max-framerate parameters signal a capability\
            that is less than the required capabilities of the signaled\
            profile and level, then the parameter SHALL be interpreted\
            as a preferred value for that capability.\
\
            Any of the parameters MAY also be used to signal\
            capabilities that exceed the required capabilities of the\
            signaled profile and level.  In that case, the parameter\
            SHALL be interpreted as the maximum value that can be\
            supported for that capability.\
\
            When more than one parameter from the set (max-width,\
            max-height, max-bitrate, max-buffer, and max-framerate) is\
            present, all signaled capabilities MUST be supported\
            simultaneously.\
\
            A sender or receiver MUST NOT use these parameters to signal\
            capabilities that meet the requirements of a higher level of\
            the VC-1 profile than that specified in the "level"\
            parameter, even if the sender or receiver can support all\
            the properties of the higher level, except if specifying a\
            higher level is not allowed due to other restrictions.  As\
            an example of such a restriction, in the SDP Offer/Answer\
            model, the value of the level parameter that can be used in\
            an Answer is limited by what was specified in the Offer.\

\
\
         max-width:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying a\
            horizontal size for the coded frames, in luma samples\
            (pixels in the luma picture).  If the value is less than the\
            maximum horizontal size allowed by the profile and level,\
            then the value specifies the preferred horizontal size.\
            Otherwise, it specifies the maximum horizontal size that is\
            supported.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum horizontal size allowed by the specified profile and\
            level.\
\
         max-height:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying a\
            vertical size for the coded frames, in luma samples (pixels\
            in a progressively coded luma picture).  If the value is\
            less than the maximum vertical size allowed by the profile\
            and level, then the value specifies the preferred vertical\
            size.  Otherwise, it specifies the maximum vertical size\
            that is supported.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum vertical size allowed by the specified profile and\
            level.\
\
         max-bitrate:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying a peak\
            transmission rate for the coded bit stream in bits per\
            second.  The number does not include the overhead caused by\
            RTP encapsulation, i.e., it does not include the AU headers,\
            or any of the RTP, UDP, or IP headers.\
\
            If the value is less than the maximum bit rate allowed by\
            the profile and level, then the value specifies the\
            preferred bit rate.  Otherwise, it specifies the maximum bit\
            rate that is supported.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\

\
         max-buffer:\
            The value is an integer specifying a leaky bucket size, B,\
            in milliseconds, required to contain a stream transmitted at\
            the transmission rate specified by the max-bitrate\

\
            parameter.  This parameter is defined in the hypothetical\
            reference decoder model for VC-1, in Annex C of SMPTE 421M\
            [1].\
\
            Note that this parameter relates to the codec bit stream\
            only and does not account for any buffering time that may be\
            required to compensate for jitter in the network.\
\
            If the value is less than the maximum leaky bucket size\
            allowed by the max-bitrate parameter and the profile and\
            level, then the value specifies the preferred leaky bucket\
            size.  Otherwise, it specifies the maximum leaky bucket size\
            that is supported for the bit rate specified by the max-\
            bitrate parameter.\
\
            If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum buffer size allowed by the specified profile and\
            level.  See the values for "BMax" and "RMax" in Annex D of\
            SMPTE 421M [1].\
\
         max-framerate:\
            The value is an integer greater than zero, specifying a\
            number of frames per second for the coded bit stream.  The\
            value is the frame rate multiplied by 1000 and rounded to\
            the nearest integer value.  For example, 30000/1001\
            (approximately 29.97) frames per second is represented as\
            29970.\
\
            If the value is less than the maximum frame rate allowed by\
            the profile and level, then the value specifies the\
            preferred frame rate.  Otherwise, it specifies the maximum\
            frame rate that is supported.\
\
            If the parameter is not specified, it defaults to the\
            maximum frame rate allowed by the specified profile and\

6.2.  Mapping of media type parameters to SDP\
\
   The information carried in the media type specification has a\
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\
   [4].  If SDP is used to specify sessions using this payload format,\
   the mapping is done as follows:\
\
   o  The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video (the type\
      name).\
\
   o  The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be vc1 (the\
      subtype name).\
\
   o  The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000.\
\
   o  The REQUIRED parameters "profile" and "level" MUST be included in\
      the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.\
\
      These parameters are expressed in the form of a semicolon\
      separated list of parameter=value pairs.\

\
\
   o  The OPTIONAL parameters "config", "width", "height", "bitrate",\
      "buffer", "framerate", "bpic", "mode", "max-width", "max-height",\
      "max-bitrate", "max-buffer", and "max-framerate", when present,\
      MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.\
\
      These parameters are expressed in the form of a semicolon\
      separated list of parameter=value pairs:\
\
         a=fmtp:<dynamic payload type> <parameter\
         name>=<value>[,<value>][; <parameter name>=<value>]\
\
   o  Any unknown parameters to the device that uses the SDP MUST be\
      ignored.  For example, parameters defined in later specifications\
      MAY be copied into the SDP and MUST be ignored by receivers that\
      do not understand them.\
\
6.3.  Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model\
\
   When VC-1 is offered over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model [5]\
   for negotiation for unicast usage, the following rules and\
   limitations apply:\
\
   o  The "profile" parameter MUST be used symmetrically, i.e., the\
      answerer MUST either maintain the parameter or remove the media\
      format (payload type) completely if the offered VC-1 profile is\
      not supported.\
\
   o  The "level" parameter specifies the highest level of the VC-1\
      profile supported by the codec.\
\
      The answerer MUST NOT specify a numerically higher level in the\
      answer than that specified in the offer.  The answerer MAY specify\
      a level that is lower than that specified in the offer, i.e., the\
      level parameter can be "downgraded".\
\
      If the offer specifies the sendrecv or sendonly direction\
      attribute and the answer downgrades the level parameter, this may\
      require a new offer to specify an updated "config" parameter.  If\
      the "config" parameter cannot be used with the level specified in\
      the answer, then the offerer MUST initiate another Offer/Answer\
      round or not use media format (payload type).\
\
   o  The parameters "config", "bpic", "width", "height", "framerate",\
      "bitrate", "buffer", and "mode", describe the properties of the\
      VC-1 bit stream that the offerer or answerer is sending for this\
      media format configuration.\

\
\
      In the case of unicast usage and when the direction attribute in\
      the offer or answer is recvonly, the interpretation of these\
      parameters is undefined and they MUST NOT be used.\
\
   o  The parameters "config", "width", "height", "bitrate", and\
      "buffer" MUST be specified when the direction attribute is\
      sendrecv or sendonly.\
\
   o  The parameters "max-width", "max-height", "max-framerate", "max-\
      bitrate", and "max-buffer" MAY be specified in an offer or an\
      answer, and their interpretation is as follows:\
\
      When the direction attribute is sendonly, the parameters describe\
      the limits of the VC-1 bit stream that the sender is capable of\
      producing for the given profile and level, and for any lower level\
      of the same profile.\
\
      When the direction attribute is recvonly or sendrecv, the\
      parameters describe properties of the receiver implementation.  If\
      the value of a property is less than that allowed by the level of\
      the VC-1 profile, then it SHALL be interpreted as a preferred\
      value and the sender's VC-1 bit stream SHOULD NOT exceed it.  If\
      the value of a property is greater than what is allowed by the\
      level of the VC-1 profile, then it SHALL be interpreted as the\
      upper limit of the value that the receiver accepts for the given\
      profile and level, and for any lower level of the same profile.\
\
      For example, if a recvonly or sendrecv offer specifies\
      "profile=0;level=1;max-bitrate=48000", then 48 kbps is merely a\
      suggested bit rate, because all receiver implementations of Simple\
      profile, Low level, are required to support bit rates of up to 96\
      kbps.  Assuming that the offer is accepted, the answerer should\
      specify "bitrate=48000" in the answer, but any value up to 96000\
      is allowed.  But if the offer specifies "max-bitrate=200000", this\
      means that the receiver implementation supports a maximum of 200\
      kbps for the given profile and level (or lower level).  In this\
      case, the answerer is allowed to answer with a bitrate parameter\
      of up to 200000.\
\
   o  If an offerer wishes to have non-symmetrical capabilities between\
      sending and receiving, e.g., use different levels in each\
      direction, then the offerer has to offer different RTP sessions.\
      This can be done by specifying different media lines declared as\
      "recvonly" and "sendonly", respectively.\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   For streams being delivered over multicast, the following rules apply\
   in addition:\
\
   o  The "level" parameter specifies the highest level of the VC-1\
      profile used by the participants in the multicast session.  The\
      value of this parameter MUST NOT be changed by the answerer.\
      Thus, a payload type can be either accepted unaltered or removed.\
\
   o  The parameters "config", "bpic", "width", "height", "framerate",\
      "bitrate", "buffer", and "mode", specify properties of the VC-1\
      bit stream that will be sent and/or received on the multicast\
      session.  The parameters MAY be specified, even if the direction\
      attribute is recvonly.\
\
      The values of these parameters MUST NOT be changed by the\
      answerer.  Thus, a payload type can be either accepted unaltered\
      or removed.\
\
   o  The values of the parameters "max-width", "max-height", "max-\
      framerate", "max-bitrate", and "max-buffer" MUST be supported by\
      the answerer for all streams declared as sendrecv or recvonly.\
      Otherwise, one of the following actions MUST be performed: the\
      media format is removed or the session is rejected.\
\
6.4.  Usage in Declarative Session Descriptions\
\
   When VC-1 is offered over RTP using SDP in a declarative style, as in\
   RTSP [12] or SAP [13], the following rules and limitations apply:\
\
   o  The parameters "profile" and "level" indicate only the properties\
      of the coded bit stream.  They do not imply a limit on\
      capabilities supported by the sender.\
\
   o  The parameters "config", "width", "height", "bitrate", and\
      "buffer" MUST be specified.\
\
   o  The parameters "max-width", "max-height", "max-framerate", "max-\
      bitrate", and "max-buffer" MUST NOT be used.\
\
   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows (Simple\
   profile, Medium level):\
\
   m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98\
   a=rtpmap:98 vc1/90000\
   a=fmtp:98 profile=0;level=2;width=352;height=288;framerate=15000;\
   bitrate=384000;buffer=2000;config=4e291800\

\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification\
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP\
   specification [4], and in any appropriate RTP profile.  This implies\
   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption;\
   for example, through the application of SRTP [11].\
\
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using\
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end\
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological RTP packets\
   into the stream that are complex to decode and that cause the\
   receiver to be overloaded.  VC-1 is particularly vulnerable to such\
   attacks, because it is possible for an attacker to generate RTP\
   packets containing frames that affect the decoding process of many\
   future frames.  Therefore, the usage of data origin authentication\
   and data integrity protection of at least the RTP packet is\
   RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP [11].\
\
   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and\
   integrity of RTP packets and their payloads is dependent on the\
   application and on the transport and signaling protocols employed.\
   Thus, although SRTP is given as an example above, other possible\
   choices exist.\
\
   VC-1 bit streams can carry user-data, such as closed captioning\
   information and content meta-data.  The VC-1 specification does not\
   define how to interpret user-data.  Identifiers for user-data are\
   required to be registered with SMPTE.  It is conceivable for types of\
   user-data to be defined to include programmatic content, such as\
   scripts or commands that would be executed by the receiver.\
   Depending on the type of user-data, it might be possible for a sender\
   to generate user-data in a non-compliant manner to crash the receiver\
   or make it temporarily unavailable.  Senders that transport VC-1 bit\
   streams SHOULD ensure that the user-data is compliant with the\
   specification registered with SMPTE (see Annex F of [1].)  Receivers\
   SHOULD prevent malfunction in case of non-compliant user-data.\
\
   It is important to note that VC-1 streams can have very high\
   bandwidth requirements (up to 135 Mbps for high-definition video).\
   This causes a potential for denial-of-service if transmitted onto\
   many Internet paths.  Therefore, users of this payload format MUST\
   comply with the congestion control requirements described in section\
   8.\

\
\
8.  Congestion Control\
\
   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550\
   [3], and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC 3551 [15].\
\
   If best-effort service is being used, users of this payload format\
   MUST monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is\
   within acceptable parameters.  Packet loss is considered acceptable\
   if a TCP flow across the same network path and experiencing the same\
   network conditions would achieve an average throughput, measured on a\
   reasonable timescale, that is not less than the RTP flow is\
   achieving.  This condition can be satisfied by implementing\
   congestion control mechanisms to adapt the transmission rate or by\
   arranging for a receiver to leave the session if the loss rate is\
   unacceptably high.\
\
   The bit rate adaptation necessary for obeying the congestion control\
   principle is easily achievable when real-time encoding is used.  When\
   pre-encoded content is being transmitted, bandwidth adaptation\
   requires one or more of the following:\
\
   -  The availability of more than one coded representation of the same\
      content at different bit rates.  The switching between the\
      different representations can normally be performed in the same\
      RTP session by switching streams at random access point\
      boundaries.\
\
   -  The existence of non-reference frames (e.g., B-frames) in the bit\
      stream.  Non-reference frames can be discarded by the transmitter\
      prior to encapsulation in RTP.\
\
   Only when non-downgradable parameters (such as the VC-1 "profile"\
   parameter) are required to be changed does it become necessary to\
   terminate and re-start the media stream.  This may be accomplished by\
   using a different RTP payload type.\
\
   Regardless of the method used for bandwidth adaptation, the resulting\
   bit stream MUST be compliant with the VC-1 specification [1].  For\
   example, if non-reference frames are discarded, then the FRMCNT\
   syntax element (Simple and Main profile frames only) and the optional\
   TFCNTR syntax element (Advanced profile frames only) must increment\
   as if no frames had been discarded.  Because the TFCNTR syntax\
   element counts the frames in the display order, which is different\
   from the order in which they are transmitted (the coded order), it\
   will require the transmitter to "look ahead" or buffer some number of\
   frames.\
\

RFC 4425              RTP Payload Format for VC-1          February 2006\
\
\
   As another example, when switching between different representations\
   of the same content, it may be necessary to signal a discontinuity by\
   modifying the FRMCNT field, or if Advanced profile is used, by\
   setting the BROKEN_LINK flag in the entry-point header to 1.\
\
   This payload format may also be used in networks that provide\
   quality-of-service guarantees.  If enhanced service is being used,\
   receivers SHOULD monitor packet loss to ensure that the service that\
   was requested is actually being delivered.  If it is not, then they\
   SHOULD assume that they are receiving best-effort service and behave\
   accordingly.\
\
9.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has registered the media type "video/vc1" and the associated RTP\
   payload format in the Media Types registry and in the RTP Payload\
   Format MIME types registry, as specified in section 6.1.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   A requirement for the development of a common control plane for both\
   optical and electronic switching equipment is that there must be\
   signaling, routing, and link management mechanisms that support data\
   plane fault recovery.  In this document, the term "recovery" is\
   generically used to denote both protection and restoration; the\
   specific terms "protection" and "restoration" are used only when\
   differentiation is required.  The subtle distinction between\
   protection and restoration is made based on the resource allocation\
   done during the recovery period (see [RFC4427]).\
\
   A label-switched path (LSP) may be subject to local (span), segment,\
   and/or end-to-end recovery.  Local span protection refers to the\
   protection of the link (and hence all the LSPs marked as required for\
   span protection and routed over the link) between two neighboring\
   switches.  Segment protection refers to the recovery of an LSP\
   segment (i.e., an SNC in the ITU-T terminology) between two nodes,\
   i.e., the boundary nodes of the segment.  End-to-end protection\
   refers to the protection of an entire LSP from the ingress to the\
   egress port.  The end-to-end recovery models discussed in this\
   document apply to segment protection where the source and destination\
   refer to the protected segment rather than the entire LSP.  Multiple\
   recovery levels may be used concurrently by a single LSP for added\
   resiliency; however, the interaction between levels affects any one\
   direction of the LSP results in both directions of the LSP being\
   switched to a new span, segment, or end-to-end path.\

\
\
   Unless otherwise stated, all references to "link" in this document\
   indicate a bi-directional link (which may be realized as a pair of\
   unidirectional links).\
\
   Consider the control plane message flow during the establishment of\
   an LSP.  This message flow proceeds from an initiating (or source)\
   node to a terminating (or destination) node, via a sequence of\
   intermediate nodes.  A node along the LSP is said to be "upstream"\
   from another node if the former occurs first in the sequence.  The\
   latter node is said to be "downstream" from the former node.  That\
   is, an "upstream" node is closer to the initiating node than a node\
   further "downstream".  Unless otherwise stated, all references to\
   "upstream" and "downstream" are in terms of the control plane message\
   flow.\
\
   The flow of the data traffic is defined from ingress (source node) to\
   egress (destination node).  Note that for bi-directional LSPs, there\
   are two different data plane flows, one for each direction of the\
   LSP.  This document presents a protocol functional description to\
   support Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-based\
   recovery (i.e., protection and restoration).  Protocol-specific\
   formats, encoding, and mechanisms will be described in companion\
   documents.\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   In addition, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the\
   terminology used in [RFC3945], [RFC3471] and referenced as well as\
   [RFC4427].\
\
2.  Span Protection\
\
   Consider a (working) link i between two nodes A and B.  There are two\
   fundamental models for span protection.  The first is referred to as\
   1+1 protection.  Under this model, a dedicated link j is pre-assigned\
   to protect link i.  LSP traffic is permanently bridged onto both\
   links i and j at the ingress node, and the egress node selects the\
   signal (i.e., normal traffic) from i or j, based on a selection\
   function (e.g., signal quality).  Under unidirectional 1+1 span\
   protection (Section 2.1), each node A and B acts autonomously to\
   select the signal from the working link i or the protection link j.\
   Under bi-directional 1+1 span protection (Section 2.2) the two nodes\
   A and B coordinate the selection function such that they select the\
   signal from the same link, i or j.\

RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   Under the second model, a set of N working links are protected by a\
   set of M protection links, usually with M =< N.  A failure in any of\
   the N working links results in traffic being switched to one of the M\
   protection links that is available.  This is typically a three-step\
   process: first the data plane failure is detected at the egress node\
   and reported (notification), then a protection link is selected, and\
   finally, the LSPs on the failed link are moved to the protection\
   link.  If reversion is supported, a fourth step is included, i.e.,\
   return of the traffic to the working link (when the working link has\
   recovered from the failure).  In Section 2.3, 1:1 span protection is\
   described.  In Section 2.4, M:N span protection is described, where\
   M =< N.\
\
2.1.  Unidirectional 1+1 Dedicated Protection\
\
   Suppose a bi-directional LSP is routed over link i between two nodes\
   A and B.  Under unidirectional 1+1 protection, a dedicated link j is\
   pre-assigned to protect the working link i.  LSP traffic is\
   permanently bridged on both links at the ingress node, and the egress\
   node selects the normal traffic from one of the links, i or j.  If a\
   node (A or B) detects a failure of a span, it autonomously invokes a\
   process to receive the traffic from the protection span.  Thus, it is\
   possible that node A selects the signal from link i in the B to A\
   direction of the LSP, and node B selects the signal from link j in\
   the A to B direction.\
\
   The following functionality is required for 1+1 unidirectional span\
   protection:\
\
      o  Routing: A single TE link encompassing both working and\
         protection links SHOULD be announced with a Link Protection\
         Type "Dedicated 1+1", along with the bandwidth parameters for\
         the working link.  As the resources are consumed/released, the\
         bandwidth parameters of the TE link are adjusted accordingly.\
         Encoding of the Link Protection Type and bandwidth parameters\
         in IS-IS is specified in [RFC4205].  Encoding of this\
         information in OSPF is specified in [RFC4203].\
\
      o  Signaling: The Link Protection object/TLV SHOULD be used to\
         request "Dedicated 1+1" link protection for that LSP.  This\
         object/TLV is defined in [RFC3471].  If the Link Protection\
         object/TLV is not used, link selection is a matter of local\
         policy.  No additional signaling is required when a fail-over\
         occurs.\

\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
      o  Link management: Both nodes MUST have a consistent view of the\
         link protection association for the spans.  This can be done\
         using the Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204], or if LMP\
         is not used, this MUST be configured manually.\
\
2.2.  Bi-directional 1+1 Dedicated Protection\
\
   Suppose a bi-directional LSP is routed over link i between two nodes\
   A and B.  Under bi-directional 1+1 protection, a dedicated link j is\
   pre-assigned to protect the working link i.  LSP traffic is\
   permanently duplicated on both links, and under normal conditions,\
   the traffic from link i is received by nodes A and B (in the\
   appropriate directions).  A failure affecting link i results in both\
   A and B switching to the traffic on link j in the respective\
   directions.  Note that some form of signaling is required to ensure\
   that both A and B start receiving traffic from the protection link.\
\
   The basic steps in 1+1 bi-directional span protection are as follows:\
\
      1. If a node (A or B) detects the failure of the working link (or\
         a degradation of signal quality over the working link), it\
         SHOULD begin receiving on the protection link and send a\
         Switchover Request message reliably to the other node (B or A,\
         respectively).  This message SHOULD indicate the identity of\
         the failed working link and provide other relevant information.\
\
      2. Upon receipt of the Switchover Request message, a node MUST\
         begin receiving from the protection link and send a Switchover\
         Response message to the other node (A or B, respectively).\
         Because both the working/protect spans are exposed to routing\
         and signaling as a single link, the switchover SHOULD be\
         transparent to routing and signaling.\
\
   The following functionality is required for 1+1 bi-directional span\
   protection:\
\
      o  The routing procedures are the same as in 1+1 unidirectional.\
\
      o  The signaling procedures are the same as in 1+1 unidirectional.\
\
      o  In addition to the procedures described in 1+1\
         (unidirectional), a Switchover Request message MUST be used to\
         signal the Switchover Request.  This can be done using LMP\
         [RFC4204].  Note that GMPLS-based mechanisms MAY not be\
         necessary when the underlying span (transport) technology\
         provides such a mechanism.\

\
\
2.3.  Dedicated 1:1 Protection with Extra Traffic\
\
   Consider two adjacent nodes, A and B.  Under 1:1 protection, a\
   dedicated link j between A and B is pre-assigned to protect working\
   link i.  Link j may be carrying (pre-emptable) Extra Traffic.  A\
   failure affecting link i results in the corresponding LSP(s) being\
   restored to link j.  Extra Traffic being routed over link j may need\
   to be pre-empted to accommodate the LSPs that have to be restored.\
\
   Once a fault is isolated/localized, the affected LSP(s) must be moved\
   to the protection link.  The process of moving an LSP from a failed\
   (working) link to a protection link must be initiated by one of the\
   nodes, A or B.  This node is referred to as the "master".  The other\
   node is called the "slave".  The determination of the master and the\
   slave may be based on configured information or protocol specific\
   requirements.\
\
   The basic steps in dedicated 1:1 span protection (ignoring reversion)\
   are as follows:\
\
      1. If the master detects/localizes a link failure event, it\
         invokes a process to allocate the protection link to the\
         affected LSP(s).\
\
      2. If the slave detects a link failure event, it informs the\
         master of the failure using a failure indication message.  The\
         master then invokes the same procedure as (1) to move the LSPs\
         to the protection link.  If the protection link is carrying\
         Extra Traffic, the slave stops using the span for the Extra\
         Traffic.\
\
      3. Once the span protection procedure is invoked in the master, it\
         requests the slave to switch the affected LSP(s) to the\
         protection link.  Prior to this, if the protection link is\
         carrying Extra Traffic, the master stops using the span for\
         this traffic (i.e., the traffic is dropped by the master and\
         not forwarded into or out of the protection link).\
\
      4. The slave sends an acknowledgement to the master.  Prior to\
         this, the slave stops using the link for Extra Traffic (i.e.,\
         the traffic is dropped by the slave and not forwarded into or\
         out of the protection link).  It then starts sending the normal\
         traffic on the selected protection link.\
\
      5. When the master receives the acknowledgement, it starts sending\
         and receiving the normal traffic over the new link.  The\
         switchover of the LSPs is thus completed.\

\
\
      Note: Although this mechanism implies more traffic dropped than\
      necessary, it is preferred over possible misconnections during the\
      recovery process.\
\
   From the description above, it is clear that 1:1 span protection may\
   require up to three signaling messages for each failed span: a\
   failure indication message, an LSP Switchover Request message, and an\
   LSP Switchover Response message.  Furthermore, it may be possible to\
   switch multiple LSPs from the working span to the protection span\
   simultaneously.\
\
   The following functionality is required for dedicated 1:1 span\
   protection:\
\
      o  Pre-emption MUST be supported to accommodate Extra Traffic.\
\
      o  Routing: A single TE link encompassing both working and\
         protection links is announced with a Link Protection Type\
         "Dedicated 1:1".  If Extra Traffic is supported over the\
         protection link, then the bandwidth parameters for the\
         protection link MUST also be announced.  The differentiation\
         between bandwidth for working and protect links is made using\
         priority mechanisms.  In other words, the network MUST be\
         configured such that bandwidth at priority X or lower is\
         considered Extra Traffic.\
\
         If there is a failure on the working link, then the normal\
         traffic is switched to the protection link, pre-empting Extra\
         Traffic if necessary.  The bandwidth for the protection link\
         MUST be adjusted accordingly.\
\
      o  Signaling: To establish an LSP on the working link, the Link\
         Protection object/TLV indicating "Dedicated 1:1" SHOULD be\
         included in the signaling request message for that LSP.  To\
         establish an LSP on the protection link, the appropriate\
         priority (indicating Extra Traffic) SHOULD be used for that\
         LSP.  These objects/TLVs are defined in [RFC3471].  If the Link\
         Protection object/TLV is not used, link selection is a matter\
         of local policy.\
\
      o  Link management: Both nodes MUST have a consistent view of the\
         link protection association for the spans.  This can be done\
         using LMP [RFC4204] or via manual configuration.\
\
      o  When a link failure is detected at the slave, a failure\
         indication message MUST be sent to the master informing the\
         node of the link failure.\

\
\
2.4.  Shared M:N Protection\
\
   Shared M:N protection is described with respect to two neighboring\
   nodes, A and B.  The scenario considered is as follows:\
\
      o  At any point in time, there are two sets of links between A and\
         B, i.e., a working set of N (bi-directional) links carrying\
         traffic subject to protection and a protection set of M (bi-\
         directional) links.  A protection link may be carrying Extra\
         Traffic.  There is no a priori relationship between the two\
         sets of links, but the value of M and N MAY be pre-configured.\
         The specific links in the protection set MAY be pre-configured\
         to be physically diverse to avoid the possibility of failure\
         events affecting a large proportion of protection links (along\
         with working links).\
\
      o  When a link in the working set is affected by a failure, the\
         normal traffic is diverted to a link in the protection set, if\
         such a link is available.  Note that such a link might be\
         carrying more than one LSP, e.g., an OC-192 link carrying four\
         STS-48 LSPs.\
\
      o  More than one link in the working set may be affected by the\
         same failure event.  In this case, there may not be an adequate\
         number of protection links to accommodate all of the affected\
         traffic carried by failed working links.  The set of affected\
         working links that are actually restored over available\
         protection links is then subject to policies (e.g., based on\
         relative priority of working traffic).  These policies are not\
         specified in this document.\
\
      o  When normal traffic must be diverted from a failed link in the\
         working set to a protection link, the decision as to which\
         protection link is chosen is always made by one of the nodes, A\
         or B.  This node is considered the "master" and it is required\
         to both apply any policies and select specific protection links\
         to divert working traffic.  The other node is considered the\
         "slave".  The determination of the master and the slave MAY be\
         based on configured information, protocol-specific\
         requirements, or as a result of running a neighbor discovery\
         procedure.\
\
      o  Failure events are detected by transport layer mechanisms, if\
         available (e.g., SONET Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)/Remote\
         Defect Indication (RDI)).  Since the bi-directional links are\
         formed by a pair of unidirectional links, a failure in the link\
         from A to B is typically detected by B, and a failure in the\
         opposite direction is detected by A.  It is possible for a\
\
\
\

\
\
         failure to simultaneously affect both directions of the bi-\
         directional link.  In this case, A and B will concurrently\
         detect failures, in the B-to-A direction and in the A-to-B\
         direction, respectively.\
\
   The basic steps in M:N protection (ignoring reversion) are as\
   follows:\
\
      1. If the master detects a failure of a working link, it\
         autonomously invokes a process to allocate a protection link to\
         the affected traffic.\
\
      2. If the slave detects a failure of a working link, it MUST\
         inform the master of the failure using a failure indication\
         message.  The master then invokes the same procedure as above\
         to allocate a protection link.  (It is possible that the master\
         has itself detected the same failure, for example, a failure\
         simultaneously affecting both directions of a link.)\
\
      3. Once the master has determined the identity of the protection\
         link, it indicates this to the slave and requests the\
         switchover of the traffic (using a "Switchover Request"\
         message).  Prior to this, if the protection link is carrying\
         Extra Traffic, the master stops using the link for this traffic\
         (i.e., the traffic is dropped by the master and not forwarded\
         into or out of the protection link).\
\
      4. The slave sends a "Switchover Response" message back to the\
         master.  Prior to this, if the selected protection link is\
         carrying traffic that could be pre-empted, the slave stops\
         using the link for this traffic (i.e., the traffic is dropped\
         by the slave and not forwarded into or out of the protection\
         link).  It then starts sending the normal traffic on the\
         selected protection link.\
\
      5. When the master receives the Switchover Response, it starts\
         sending and receiving the traffic that was previously carried\
         on the now-failed link over the new link.\
\
      Note: Although this mechanism implies more traffic dropped than\
      necessary, it is preferred over possible misconnections during the\
      recovery process.\
\
   From the description above, it is clear that M:N span restoration\
   (involving LSP local recovery) MAY require up to three messages for\
   each working link being switched: a failure indication message, a\
   Switchover Request message, and a Switchover Response message.\

RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   The following functionality is required for M:N span restoration:\
\
      o  Pre-emption MUST be supported to accommodate Extra Traffic.\
\
      o  Routing: A single TE link encompassing both sets of working and\
         protect links should be announced with a Link Protection Type\
         "Shared M:N".  If Extra Traffic is supported over a set of the\
         protection links, then the bandwidth parameters for the set of\
         protection links MUST also be announced.  The differentiation\
         between bandwidth for working and protect links is made using\
         priority mechanisms.\
\
         If there is a failure on a working link, then the affected\
         LSP(s) MUST be switched to a protection link, pre-empting Extra\
         Traffic if necessary.  The bandwidth for the protection link\
         MUST be adjusted accordingly.\
\
      o  Signaling: To establish an LSP on the working link, the Link\
         Protection object/TLV indicating "Shared M:N" SHOULD be\
         included in the signaling request message for that LSP.  To\
         establish an LSP on the protection link, the appropriate\
         priority (indicating Extra Traffic) SHOULD be used.  These\
         objects/TLVs are defined in [RFC3471].  If the Link Protection\
         object/TLV is not used, link selection is a matter of local\
         policy.\
\
      o  For link management, both nodes MUST have a consistent view of\
         the link protection association for the links.  This can be\
         done using LMP [RFC4204] or via manual configuration.\
\
2.5.  Messages\
\
   The following messages are used in local span protection procedures.\
\
   These messages SHOULD be delivered reliably.  Therefore, the protocol\
   mechanisms used to deliver these messages SHOULD provide sequencing,\
   acknowledgement, and retransmission.  The protocol SHOULD also handle\
   situations where the message(s) cannot be delivered.\
\
   The messages described in the following subsections are abstract;\
   their format and encoding will be described in separate documents.\
\
2.5.1.  Failure Indication Message\
\
   This message is sent from the slave to the master to indicate the\
   identities of one or more failed working links.  This message MAY not\
   be necessary when the transport plane technology itself provides for\
   such a notification.\
\
\
\
Lang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 10]\
\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   The number of links included in the message depends on the number of\
   failures detected within a window of time by the sending node.  A\
   node MAY choose to send separate failure indication messages in the\
   interest of completing the recovery for a given link within an\
   implementation-dependent time constraint.\
\
2.5.2.  Switchover Request Message\
\
   Under bi-directional 1+1 span protection, this message is used to\
   coordinate the selecting function at both nodes.  This message\
   originated at the node that detected the failure.\
\
   Under dedicated 1:1 and shared M:N span protection, this message is\
   used as an LSP Switchover Request.  This message is sent from the\
   master node to the slave node (reliably) to indicate that the LSP(s)\
   on the (failed) working link can be switched to an available\
   protection link.  If so, the ID of the protection link, as well as\
   the LSP labels (if necessary), MUST be indicated.  These identifiers\
   MUST be consistent with those used in GMPLS signaling.\
\
   A working link may carry multiple LSPs.  Since the normal traffic\
   carried over the working link is switched to the protection link, it\
   MAY be possible for the LSPs on the working link to be mapped to the\
   protection link without re-signaling each individual LSP.  For\
   example, if link bundling [RFC4201] is used where the working and\
   protect links are mapped to component links, and the labels are the\
   same on the working and protection links, it MAY be possible to\
   change the component links without needing to re-signal each\
   individual LSP.  Optionally, the labels MAY need to be explicitly\
   coordinated between the two nodes.  In this case, the Switchover\
   Request message SHOULD carry the new label mappings.\
\
   The master may not be able to find protection links to accommodate\
   all failed working links.  Thus, if this message is generated in\
   response to a Failure Indication message from the slave, then the set\
   of failed links in the message MAY be a sub-set of the links received\
   in the Failure Indication message.  Depending on time constraints,\
   the master may switch the normal traffic from the set of failed links\
   in smaller batches.  Thus, a single failure indication message MAY\
   result in the master sending more than one Switchover Request message\
   to the same slave node.\
\
2.5.3.  Switchover Response Message\
\
   This message is sent from the slave to the master (reliably) to\
   indicate the completion (or failure) of switchover at the slave.  In\
   this message, the slave MAY indicate that it cannot switch over to\
   the corresponding free link for some reason.  In this case, the\

\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   master and slave notify the user (operator) of the failed switchover.\
   A notification of the failure MAY also be used as a trigger in an\
   end-to-end recovery.\
\
2.6.  Preventing Unintended Connections\
\
   An unintended connection occurs when traffic from the wrong source is\
   delivered to a receiver.  This MUST be prevented during protection\
   switching.  This is primarily a concern when the protection link is\
   being used to carry Extra Traffic.  In this case, it MUST be ensured\
   that the LSP traffic being switched from the (failed) working link to\
   the protection link is not delivered to the receiver of the pre-\
   empted traffic.  Thus, in the message flow described above, the\
   master node MUST disconnect (any) pre-empted traffic on the selected\
   protection link before sending the Switchover Request.  The slave\
   node MUST also disconnect pre-empted traffic before sending the\
   Switchover Response.  In addition, the master node SHOULD start\
   receiving traffic for the protected LSP from the protection link.\
   Finally, the master node SHOULD start sending protected traffic on\
   the protection link upon receipt of the Switchover Response.\
\
3.  End-to-End (Path) Protection and Restoration\
\
   End-to-end path protection and restoration refer to the recovery of\
   an entire LSP from the initiator to the terminator.  Suppose the\
   primary path of an LSP is routed from the initiator (Node A) to the\
   terminator (Node B) through a set of intermediate nodes.\
\
   The following subsections describe three previously proposed end-to-\
   end protection schemes and the functional steps needed to implement\
   them.\
\
3.1.  Unidirectional 1+1 Protection\
\
   A dedicated, resource-disjoint alternate path is pre-established to\
   protect the LSP.  Traffic is simultaneously sent on both paths and\
   received from one of the functional paths by the end nodes A and B.\
\
   There is no explicit signaling involved with this mode of protection.\
\
3.2.  Bi-directional 1+1 Protection\
\
   A dedicated, resource-disjoint alternate path is pre-established to\
   protect the LSP.  Traffic is simultaneously sent on both paths; under\
   normal conditions, the traffic from the working path is received by\
   nodes A and B (in the appropriate directions).  A failure affecting\
   the working path results in both A and B switching to the traffic on\
   the protection path in the respective directions.\
\
\
\
Lang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 12]\
\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   Note that this requires coordination between the end nodes to switch\
   to the protection path.\
\
   The basic steps in bi-directional 1+1 path protection are as follows:\
\
      o  Failure detection: There are two possibilities for this.\
\
            1. A node in the working path detects a failure event.  Such\
               a node MUST send a Failure Indication message toward the\
               upstream or/and downstream end node of the LSP (node A or\
               B).  This message MAY be forwarded along the working path\
               or routed over a different path if the network has\
               general routing intelligence.\
\
               Mechanisms provided by the data transport plane MAY also\
               be used for this, if available.\
\
            2. The end nodes (A or B) detect the failure themselves\
               (e.g., loss of signal).\
\
      o  Switchover: The action taken when an end node detects a failure\
         in the working path is as follows: Start receiving from the\
         protection path; at the same time, send a Switchover Request\
         message to the other end node to enable switching at the other\
         end.\
\
         The action taken when an end node receives a Switchover Request\
         message is as follows:\
\
            -  Start receiving from the protection path; at the same\
               time, send a Switchover Response message to the other end\
               node.\
\
   GMPLS signaling mechanisms MAY be used to (reliably) signal the\
   Failure Indication message, as well as the Switchover Request and\
   Response message.  These messages MAY be forwarded along the\
   protection path if no other routing intelligence is available in the\
   network.\
\
3.2.1.  Identifiers\
\
   LSP Identifier: A unique identifier for each LSP.  The LSP identifier\
   is within the scope of the Source ID and Destination ID.\
\
   Source ID: ID of the source (e.g., IP address).\
\
   Destination ID: ID of the destination (e.g., IP address).\

\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
3.2.2.  Nodal Information\
\
   Each node that is on the working or protection path of an LSP MUST\
   have knowledge of the LSP identifier.  If the network does not\
   provide routing intelligence, nodal information MAY also include\
   previous and next nodes in the LSP so that restoration-related\
   messages can be forwarded properly.  When the network provides\
   general routing intelligence, messages MAY be forwarded along paths\
   other than that of the LSP.\
\
   At the end-point nodes, the working and protection paths MUST be\
   associated.  The association of these paths MAY be either provisioned\
   using signaling or MAY be configured when LSP provisioning does not\
   involve signaling (e.g., provisioning through a management system).\
   The related association information MUST remain until the LSP is\
   explicitly de-provisioned.\
\
3.2.3.  End-to-End Failure Indication Message\
\
   This message is sent (reliably) by an intermediate node toward the\
   source of an LSP.  For instance, such a node might have attempted\
   local span protection and failed.  This message MAY not be necessary\
   if the data transport layer provides mechanisms for the notification\
   of LSP failure by the endpoints (i.e., if LSP endpoints are co-\
   located with a corresponding data (transport) maintenance/recovery\
   domain).\
\
   Consider a node that detects a link failure.  The node MUST determine\
   the identities of all LSPs that are affected by the failure of the\
   link and send an End-to-End Failure Indication message to the source\
   of each LSP.  For scalability reasons, Failure Indication messages\
   MAY contain the identity and the status of multiple LSPs rather than\
   a single one.  Each intermediate node receiving such a message MUST\
   forward the message to the appropriate next node such that the\
   message would ultimately reach the LSP source.  However, there is no\
   requirement that this message flows toward the source along the same\
   path as the failed LSP.  Furthermore, if an intermediate node is\
   itself generating a Failure Indication message, there SHOULD be a\
   mechanism to suppress all but one source of Failure Indication\
   messages.  Finally, the Failure Indication message MUST be sent\
   reliably from the node detecting the failure to the LSP source.\
   Reliability MAY be achieved, for example, by retransmitting the\
   message until an acknowledgement is received.  However,\
   retransmission of Failure Indication messages SHOULD not cause\
   further message drops.  This MAY be achieved through the appropriate\
   configuration and use of congestion and flow control mechanisms.\

\
\
3.2.4.  End-to-End Failure Acknowledgement Message\
\
   This message is sent by the source node to acknowledge the receipt of\
   an End-to-End Failure Indication message.  This message is sent to\
   the originator of the Failure Indication message.  The Acknowledge\
   message SHOULD be sent for each Failure Indication Message received.\
   Each intermediate node receiving the Failure Acknowledgement message\
   MUST forward it toward the destination of the message.  However,\
   there is no requirement that this message flows toward the\
   destination along the same path as the failed LSP.\
\
   This message MAY not be required if other means of ensuring reliable\
   message delivery are used.\
\
3.2.5.  End-to-End Switchover Request Message\
\
   This message is generated by the source node receiving an indication\
   of failure in an LSP.  It is sent to the LSP destination, and it\
   carries the identifier of the LSP being restored.  The End-to-End\
   Switchover Request message MUST be sent reliably from the source to\
   the destination of the LSP.\
\
3.2.6.  End-to-End Switchover Response Message\
\
   This message is sent by the destination node receiving an End-to-End\
   Switchover Request message toward the source of the LSP.  This\
   message SHOULD identify the LSP being switched over.  This message\
   MUST be transmitted in response to each End-to-End Switchover Request\
   message received and MAY indicate either a positive or negative\
   outcome.\
\
3.3.  Shared Mesh Restoration\
\
   Shared mesh restoration refers to schemes under which protection\
   paths for multiple LSPs share common link and node resources.  Under\
   these schemes, the protection capacity is pre-reserved, i.e., link\
   capacity is allocated to protect one or more LSPs, but explicit\
   action is required to instantiate a specific protection LSP.  This\
   requires restoration signaling along the protection path.  Typically,\
   the protection capacity is shared only amongst LSPs whose working\
   paths are physically diverse.  This criterion can be enforced when\
   provisioning the protection path.  Specifically, provisioning-related\
   signaling messages may carry information about the working path to\
   nodes along the protection path.  This can be used as call admission\
   control to accept/reject connections along the protection path based\
   on the identification of the resources used for the primary path.\
\
\
\

\
Lang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 15]\
\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   Thus, shared mesh restoration is designed to protect an LSP after a\
   single failure event, i.e., a failure that affects the working path\
   of at most one LSP sharing the protection capacity.  It is possible\
   that a protection path may not be successfully activated when\
   multiple, concurrent failure events occur.  In this case, shared mesh\
   restoration capacity may be claimed for more than one failed LSP and\
   the protection path can be activated only for one of them (at most).\
\
   For implementing shared mesh restoration, the identifier and nodal\
   information related to signaling along the control path are as\
   defined for 1+1 protection in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.  In addition,\
   each node MUST also keep (local) information needed to establish the\
   data plane of the protection path.  This information MUST indicate\
   the local resources to be allocated, the fabric cross-connect to be\
   established to activate the path, etc.  The precise nature of this\
   information would depend on the type of node and LSP (the GMPLS\
   signaling document describes different type of switches [RFC3471]).\
   It would also depend on whether the information is fine or coarse-\
   grained.  For example, fine-grained information would indicate pre-\
   selection of all details pertaining to protection path activation,\
   such as outgoing link, labels, etc.  Coarse-grained information, on\
   the other hand, would allow some details to be determined during\
   protection path activation.  For example, protection resources may be\
   pre-selected at the level of a TE link, while the selection of the\
   specific component link and label occurs during protection path\
   activation.\
\
   While the coarser specification allows some flexibility in the\
   selection of the precise resource to activate, it also adds\
   complexity in decision making and signaling during the time-critical\
   restoration phase.  Furthermore, the procedures for the assignment of\
   bandwidth to protection paths MUST take into account the total\
   resources in a TE link so that single-failure survivability\
   requirements are satisfied.\
\
3.3.1.  End-to-End Failure Indication and Acknowledgement Message\
\
   The End-to-End failure indication and acknowledgement procedures and\
   messages are as defined in Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.\
\
3.3.2.  End-to-End Switchover Request Message\
\
   This message is generated by the source node receiving an indication\
   of failure in an LSP.  It is sent to the LSP destination along the\
   protection path, and it identifies the LSP being restored.  If any\
   intermediate node is unable to establish cross-connects for the\
   protection path, then it is desirable that no other node in the path\

\
\
   establishes cross-connects for the path.  This would allow shared\
   mesh restoration paths to be efficiently utilized.\
\
   The End-to-End Switchover message MUST be sent reliably from the\
   source to the destination of the LSP along the protection path.\
\
3.3.3.  End-to-End Switchover Response Message\
\
   This message is sent by the destination node receiving an End-to-End\
   Switchover Request message toward the source of the LSP, along the\
   protection path.  This message SHOULD identify the LSP that is being\
   switched over.  Prior to activating the secondary bandwidth at each\
   hop along the path, Extra Traffic (if used) MUST be dropped and not\
   forwarded.\
\
   This message MUST be transmitted in response to each End-to-End\
   Switchover Request message received.\
\
4.  Reversion and Other Administrative Procedures\
\
   Reversion refers to the process of moving an LSP back to the original\
   working path after a failure is cleared and the path is repaired.\
   Reversion applies both to local span and end-to-end path-protected\
   LSPs.  Reversion is desired for the following reasons.  First, the\
   protection path may not be optimal in comparison to the working path\
   from a routing and resource consumption point of view.  Second,\
   moving an LSP to its working path allows the protection resources to\
   be used to protect other LSPs.  Reversion has the disadvantage of\
   causing a second service disruption.  Use of reversion is at the\
   option of the operator.  Reversion implies that a working path\
   remains allocated to the LSP that was originally routed over it, even\
   after a failure.  It is important to have mechanisms that allow\
   reversion to be performed with minimal service disruption to the\
   customer.  This can be achieved using a "bridge-and-switch" approach\
   (often referred to as make-before-break).\
\
   The basic steps involved in bridge-and-switch are as follows:\
\
      1. The source node commences the process by "bridging" the normal\
         traffic onto both the working and the protection paths (or\
         links in the case of span protection).\
\
      2. Once the bridging process is complete, the source node sends a\
         Bridge and Switch Request message to the destination,\
         identifying the LSP and other information necessary to perform\
         reversion.  Upon receipt of this message, the destination\
\
\

\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
         selects the traffic from the working path.  At the same time,\
         it bridges the transmitted traffic onto both the working and\
         protection paths.\
\
      3. The destination then sends a Bridge and Switch Response message\
         to the source confirming the completion of the operation.\
\
      4. When the source receives this message, it switches to receive\
         from the working path, and stops transmitting traffic on the\
         protection path.  The source then sends a Bridge and Switch\
         Completed message to the destination confirming that the LSP\
         has been reverted.\
\
      5. Upon receipt of this message, the destination stops\
         transmitting along the protection path and de-activates the LSP\
         along this path.  The de-activation procedure should remove the\
         crossed connections along the protection path (and frees the\
         resources to be used for restoring other failures).\
\
   Administrative procedures other than reversion include the ability to\
   force a switchover (from working to protection or vice versa) and\
   locking out switchover, i.e., preventing an LSP from moving from\
   working to protection administratively.  These administrative\
   conditions have to be supported by signaling.\
\
5.  Discussion\
\
5.1.  LSP Priorities During Protection\
\
   Under span protection, a failure event could affect more than one\
   working link and there could be fewer protection links than the\
   number of failed working links.  Furthermore, a working link may\
   contain multiple LSPs of varying priority.  Under this scenario, a\
   decision must be made as to which working links (and therefore LSPs)\
   should be protected.  This decision MAY be based on LSP priorities.\
\
   In general, a node might detect failures sequentially, i.e., all\
   failed working links may not be detected simultaneously, but only\
   sequentially.  In this case, as per the proposed signaling\
   procedures, LSPs on a working link MAY be switched over to a given\
   protection link, but another failure (of a working link carrying\
   higher priority LSPs) may be detected soon afterward.  In this case,\
   the new LSPs may bump the ones previously switched over the\
   protection link.\
\
   In the case of end-to-end shared mesh restoration, priorities MAY be\
   implemented for allocating shared link resources under multiple\
   failure scenarios.  As described in Section 3.3, more than one LSP\
\
\
\
Lang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 18]\
\
RFC 4426        GMPLS Recovery Functional Specification       March 2006\
\
\
   can claim shared resources under multiple failure scenarios.  If such\
   resources are first allocated to a lower-priority LSP, they MAY have\
   to be reclaimed and allocated to a higher-priority LSP.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   There are a number of security threats that MAY be experienced due to\
   the exchange of messages and information, as detailed in this\
   document.  Some examples include interception, spoofing,\
   modification, and replay of control messages.  Therefore, the\
   following security requirements are applicable to the mechanisms of\
   this document.\
\
      o  Signaling MUST be able to provide authentication, integrity,\
         and protection against replay attacks.\
\
      o  Privacy and confidentiality are not required.  Only\
         authentication is required to ensure that the signaling\
         messages are originating from the right place and have not been\
         modified in transit.\
\
      o  Protection of the identity of the data plane end-points (in\
         Failure Indication messages) is not required\
\
   The consequences of poorly secured protection may increase the risk\
   of triggering recovery actions under false Failure Indication\
   messages, including LSP identifiers that are not under failure.  Such\
   information could subsequently trigger the initiation of "false"\
   recovery actions while there are no reasons to do so.  Additionally,\
   if the identification of the LSP is tampered with from a Failure\
   Indication message, recovery actions will involve nodes for which the\
   LSPs do not indicate any failure condition or for which no Failure\
   Indication message has been received.  The consequences of such\
   actions is unpredictable and MAY lead to de-synchronisation between\
   the control and the data plane, as well as increase the risk of\
   misconnections.  Moreover, the consequences of poorly applied\
   protection may increase the risk of misconnection.  In particular,\
   when Extra Traffic is involved, it is easily possible to deliver the\
   wrong traffic to the wrong destination.  Similarly, an intrusion that\
   sets up what appears to be a valid protection LSP and then causes a\
   fault may be able to divert traffic.\
\
   Moreover, tampering with a routing information exchange may also have\
   an effect on traffic engineering.  Therefore, any mechanisms used for\
   securing and authenticating the transmission of routing information\
   SHOULD be applied in the present context.\

RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document defines a common terminology for Generalized Multi-\
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-based recovery mechanisms (i.e.,\
   protection and restoration).\
\
   The terminology proposed in this document is independent of the\
   underlying transport technologies and borrows from the G.808.1 ITU-T\
   Recommendation [G.808.1] and from the G.841 ITU-T Recommendation\
   [G.841].  The restoration terminology and concepts have been gathered\
   from numerous sources including IETF documents.\
\
   In the context of this document, the term "recovery" denotes both\
   protection and restoration.  The specific terms "protection" and\
   "restoration" will only be used when differentiation is required.\
\
   This document focuses on the terminology for the recovery of Label\
   Switched Paths (LSPs) controlled by a GMPLS control plane.  The\
   proposed terminology applies to end-to-end, segment, and span (i.e.,\
   link) recovery.  Note that the terminology for recovery of the\
   control plane itself is not in the scope of this document.\
\
   Protection and restoration of switched LSPs under tight time\
   constraints is a challenging problem.  This is particularly relevant\
   to optical networks that consist of Time Division Multiplex (TDM)\
   and/or all-optical (photonic) cross-connects referred to as GMPLS\
   nodes (or simply nodes, or even sometimes "Label Switching Routers,\
   or LSRs") connected in a general topology [RFC3945].\
\
   Recovery typically involves the activation of a recovery (or\
   alternate) LSP when a failure is encountered in the working LSP.\
\
   A working or recovery LSP is characterized by an ingress interface,\
   an egress interface, and a set of intermediate nodes and spans\
   through which the LSP is routed.  The working and recovery LSPs are\
   typically resource disjoint (e.g., node and/or span disjoint).  This\
   ensures that a single failure will not affect both the working and\
   recovery LSPs.\
\
   A bi-directional span between neighboring nodes is usually realized\
   as a pair of unidirectional spans.  Therefore, the end-to-end path\
   for a bi-directional LSP consists of a series of bi-directional\
   segments (i.e., Sub-Network Connections, or SNCs, in the ITU-T\
   terminology) between the source and destination nodes, traversing\
   intermediate nodes.\

\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
4.  Recovery Terminology Common to Protection and Restoration\
\
   This section defines the following general terms common to both\
   protection and restoration (i.e., recovery).  In addition, most of\
   these terms apply to end-to-end, segment, and span LSP recovery.\
   Note that span recovery does not protect the nodes at each end of the\
   span, otherwise end-to-end or segment LSP recovery should be used.\
\
   The terminology and the definitions were originally taken from\
   [G.808.1].  However, for generalization, the following language,\
   which is not directly related to recovery, has been adapted to GMPLS\
   and the common IETF terminology:\
\
   An LSP is used as a generic term to designate either an SNC (Sub-\
   Network Connection) or an NC (Network Connection) in ITU-T\
   terminology.  The ITU-T uses the term transport entity to designate\
   either a link, an SNC, or an NC.  The term "Traffic" is used instead\
   of "Traffic Signal".  The term protection or restoration "scheme" is\
   used instead of protection or restoration "architecture".\
\
   The reader is invited to read [G.841] and [G.808.1] for references to\
   SDH protection and Generic Protection Switching terminology,\
   respectively.  Note that restoration is not in the scope of\
   [G.808.1].\

\
\
4.1.  Working and Recovery LSP/Span\
\
   A working LSP/span is an LSP/span transporting "normal" user traffic.\
   A recovery LSP/span is an LSP/span used to transport "normal" user\
   traffic when the working LSP/span fails.  Additionally, the recovery\
   LSP/span may transport "extra" user traffic (i.e., pre-emptable\
   traffic) when normal traffic is carried over the working LSP/span.\
\
4.2.  Traffic Types\
\
   The different types of traffic that can be transported over an\
   LSP/span, in the context of this document, are defined hereafter:\
\
   A. Normal traffic:\
\
   User traffic that may be protected by two alternative LSPs/spans (the\
   working and recovery LSPs/spans).\
\
   B. Extra traffic:\
\
   User traffic carried over recovery resources (e.g., a recovery\
   LSP/span) when these resources are not being used for the recovery of\
   normal traffic (i.e., when the recovery resources are in standby\
   mode).  When the recovery resources are required to recover normal\
   traffic from the failed working LSP/span, the extra traffic is pre-\
   empted.  Extra traffic is not protected by definition, but may be\
   restored.  Moreover, extra traffic does not need to commence or be\
   terminated at the ends of the LSPs/spans that it uses.\
\
   C. Null traffic:\
\
   Traffic carried over the recovery LSP/span if it is not used to carry\
   normal or extra traffic.  Null traffic can be any kind of traffic\
   that conforms to the signal structure of the specific layer, and it\
   is ignored (not selected) at the egress of the recovery LSP/span.\
\
4.3.  LSP/Span Protection and Restoration\
\
   The following subtle distinction is generally made between the terms\
   "protection" and "restoration", even though these terms are often\
   used interchangeably [RFC3386].\
\
   The distinction between protection and restoration is made based on\
   the resource allocation done during the recovery LSP/span\
   establishment.  The distinction between different types of\
   restoration is made based on the level of route computation,\
   signaling, and resource allocation during the restoration LSP/span\
   establishment.\

RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   A. LSP/Span Protection\
\
   LSP/span protection denotes the paradigm whereby one or more\
   dedicated protection LSP(s)/span(s) is/are fully established to\
   protect one or more working LSP(s)/span(s).\
\
   For a protection LSP, this implies that route computation took place,\
   that the LSP was fully signaled all the way, and that its resources\
   were fully selected (i.e., allocated) and cross-connected between the\
   ingress and egress nodes.\
\
   For a protection span, this implies that the span has been selected\
   and reserved for protection.\
\
   Indeed, it means that no signaling takes place to establish the\
   protection LSP/span when a failure occurs.  However, various other\
   kinds of signaling may take place between the ingress and egress\
   nodes for fault notification, to synchronize their use of the\
   protection LSP/span, for reversion, etc.\
\
   B. LSP/Span Restoration\
\
   LSP/span restoration denotes the paradigm whereby some restoration\
   resources may be pre-computed, signaled, and selected a priori, but\
   not cross-connected to restore a working LSP/span.  The complete\
   establishment of the restoration LSP/span occurs only after a failure\
   of the working LSP/span, and requires some additional signaling.\
\
   Both protection and restoration require signaling.  Signaling to\
   establish the recovery resources and signaling associated with the\
   use of the recovery LSP(s)/span(s) are needed.\
\
4.4.  Recovery Scope\
\
   Recovery can be applied at various levels throughout the network.  An\
   LSP may be subject to local (span), segment, and/or end-to-end\
   recovery.\
\
   Local (span) recovery refers to the recovery of an LSP over a link\
   between two nodes.\
\
   End-to-end recovery refers to the recovery of an entire LSP from its\
   source (ingress node end-point) to its destination (egress node end-\
   point).\
\
   Segment recovery refers to the recovery over a portion of the network\
   of a segment LSP (i.e., an SNC in the ITU-T terminology) of an end-\
   to-end LSP.  Such recovery protects against span and/or node failure\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   over a particular portion of the network that is traversed by an\
   end-to-end LSP.\
\
4.5.  Recovery Domain\
\
   A recovery domain is defined as a set of nodes and spans, over which\
   one or more recovery schemes are provided.  A recovery domain served\
   by one single recovery scheme is referred to as a "single recovery\
   domain", while a recovery domain served by multiple recovery schemes\
   is referred to as a "multi recovery domain".\
\
   The recovery operation is contained within the recovery domain.  A\
   GMPLS recovery domain must be entirely contained within a GMPLS\
   domain.  A GMPLS domain (defined as a set of nodes and spans\
   controlled by GMPLS) may contain multiple recovery domains.\
\
4.6.  Recovery Types\
\
   The different recovery types can be classified depending on the\
   number of recovery LSPs/spans that are protecting a given number of\
   working LSPs/spans.  The definitions given hereafter are from the\
   point of view of a working LSP/span that needs to be protected by a\
   recovery scheme.\
\
   A. 1+1 type: dedicated protection\
\
   One dedicated protection LSP/span protects exactly one working\
   LSP/span, and the normal traffic is permanently duplicated at the\
   ingress node on both the working and protection LSPs/spans.  No extra\
   traffic can be carried over the protection LSP/span.\
\
   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection, but not to LSP/span\
   restoration.\
\
   B. 0:1 type: unprotected\
\
   No specific recovery LSP/span protects the working LSP/span.\
   However, the working LSP/span can potentially be restored through any\
   alternate available route/span, with or without any pre-computed\
   restoration route.  Note that no resources are pre-established for\
   this recovery type.\
\
   This type is applicable to LSP/span restoration, but not to LSP/span\
   protection.  Span restoration can be achieved, for instance, by\
   moving all the LSPs transported over a failed span to a dynamically\
   selected span.\

\
RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   C. 1:1 type: dedicated recovery with extra traffic\
\
   One specific recovery LSP/span protects exactly one specific working\
   LSP/span, but the normal traffic is transmitted over only one LSP\
   (working or recovery) at a time.  Extra traffic can be transported\
   using the recovery LSP/span resources.\
\
   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\
   but not to span restoration.\
\
   D. 1:N (N > 1) type: shared recovery with extra traffic\
\
   A specific recovery LSP/span is dedicated to the protection of up to\
   N working LSPs/spans.  The set of working LSPs/spans is explicitly\
   identified.  Extra traffic can be transported over the recovery\
   LSP/span.  All these LSPs/spans must start and end at the same nodes.\
\
   Sometimes, the working LSPs/spans are assumed to be resource disjoint\
   in the network so that they do not share any failure probability, but\
   this is not mandatory.  Obviously, if more than one working LSP/span\
   in the set of N are affected by some failure(s) at the same time, the\
   traffic on only one of these failed LSPs/spans may be recovered over\
   the recovery LSP/span.  Note that N can be arbitrarily large (i.e.,\
   infinite).  The choice of N is a policy decision.\
\
   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\
   but not to span restoration.\
\
   Note: a shared recovery where each recovery resource can be shared by\
   a maximum of X LSPs/spans is not defined as a recovery type but as a\
   recovery scheme.  The choice of X is a network resource management\
   policy decision.\
\
   E. M:N (M, N > 1, N >= M) type:\
\
   A set of M specific recovery LSPs/spans protects a set of up to N\
   specific working LSPs/spans.  The two sets are explicitly identified.\
   Extra traffic can be transported over the M recovery LSPs/spans when\
   available.  All the LSPs/spans must start and end at the same nodes.\
\
   Sometimes, the working LSPs/spans are assumed to be resource disjoint\
   in the network so that they do not share any failure probability, but\
   this is not mandatory.  Obviously, if several working LSPs/spans in\
   the set of N are concurrently affected by some failure(s), the\
   traffic on only M of these failed LSPs/spans may be recovered.  Note\
   that N can be arbitrarily large (i.e., infinite).  The choice of N\
   and M is a policy decision.\

\
\
   This type is applicable to LSP/span protection and LSP restoration,\
   but not to span restoration.\
\
4.7.  Bridge Types\
\
   A bridge is the function that connects the normal traffic and extra\
   traffic to the working and recovery LSP/span.\
\
   A. Permanent bridge\
\
   Under a 1+1 type, the bridge connects the normal traffic to both the\
   working and protection LSPs/spans.  This type of bridge is not\
   applicable to restoration types.  There is, of course, no extra\
   traffic connected to the recovery LSP/span.\
\
   B. Broadcast bridge\
\
   For 1:N and M:N types, the bridge permanently connects the normal\
   traffic to the working LSP/span.  In the event of recovery switching,\
   the normal traffic is additionally connected to the recovery\
   LSP/span.  Extra traffic is either not connected or connected to the\
   recovery LSP/span.\
\
   C. Selector bridge\
\
   For 1:N and M:N types, the bridge connects the normal traffic to\
   either the working or the recovery LSP/span.  Extra traffic is either\
   not connected or connected to the recovery LSP/span.\
\
4.8.  Selector Types\
\
   A selector is the function that extracts the normal traffic from\
   either the working or the recovery LSP/span.  Extra traffic is either\
   extracted from the recovery LSP/span, or is not extracted.\
\
   A. Selective selector\
\
   Is a selector that extracts the normal traffic from either the\
   working LSP/span output or the recovery LSP/span output.\
\
   B. Merging selector\
\
   For 1:N and M:N protection types, the selector permanently extracts\
   the normal traffic from both the working and recovery LSP/span\
\
   outputs.  This alternative works only in combination with a selector\
   bridge.\

\
\
4.9.  Recovery GMPLS Nodes\
\
   This section defines the GMPLS nodes involved during recovery.\
\
   A. Ingress GMPLS node of an end-to-end LSP/segment LSP/span\
\
   The ingress node of an end-to-end LSP/segment LSP/span is where the\
   normal traffic may be bridged to the recovery end-to-end LSP/segment\
   LSP/span.  Also known as source node in the ITU-T terminology.\
\
   B. Egress GMPLS node of an end-to-end LSP/segment LSP/span\
\
   The egress node of an end-to-end LSP/segment LSP/span is where the\
   normal traffic may be selected from either the working or the\
   recovery end-to-end LSP/segment LSP/span.  Also known as sink node in\
   the ITU-T terminology.\
\
   C. Intermediate GMPLS node of an end-to-end LSP/segment LSP\
\
   A node along either the working or recovery end-to-end LSP/segment\
   LSP route between the corresponding ingress and egress nodes.  Also\
   known as intermediate node in the ITU-T terminology.\
\
4.10.  Switch-over Mechanism\
\
   A switch-over is an action that can be performed at both the bridge\
   and the selector.  This action is as follows:\
\
   A. For the selector:\
\
   The action of selecting normal traffic from the recovery LSP/span\
   rather than from the working LSP/span.\
\
   B. For the bridge:\
\
   In case of permanent connection to the working LSP/span, the action\
   of connecting or disconnecting the normal traffic to or from the\
   recovery LSP/span.  In case of non-permanent connection to the\
   working LSP/span, the action of connecting the normal traffic to the\
   recovery LSP/span.\
\
4.11.  Reversion operations\
\
   A revertive recovery operation refers to a recovery switching\
   operation, where the traffic returns to (or remains on) the working\
   LSP/span when the switch-over requests are terminated (i.e., when the\
   working LSP/span has recovered from the failure).\
\
\
\
\
Mannie & Papadimitriou       Informational                     [Page 11]\
\
RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   Therefore, a non-revertive recovery switching operation is when the\
   traffic does not return to the working LSP/span when the switch-over\
   requests are terminated.\
\
4.12.  Failure Reporting\
\
   This section gives (for information) several signal types commonly\
   used in transport planes to report a failure condition.  Note that\
   fault reporting may require additional signaling mechanisms.\
\
   A. Signal Degrade (SD): a signal indicating that the associated data\
   has degraded.\
\
   B. Signal Fail (SF): a signal indicating that the associated data has\
   failed.\
\
   C. Signal Degrade Group (SDG): a signal indicating that the\
   associated group data has degraded.\
\
   D. Signal Fail Group (SFG): a signal indicating that the associated\
   group has failed.\
\
   Note: SDG and SFG definitions are under discussion at the ITU-T.\
\
4.13.  External commands\
\
   This section defines several external commands, typically issued by\
   an operator through the Network Management System (NMS)/Element\
   Management System (EMS), that can be used to influence or command the\
   recovery schemes.\
\
   A. Lockout of recovery LSP/span:\
\
   A configuration action, initiated externally, that results in the\
   recovery LSP/span being temporarily unavailable to transport traffic\
   (either normal or extra traffic).\
\
   B. Lockout of normal traffic:\
\
   A configuration action, initiated externally, that results in the\
   normal traffic being temporarily not allowed to be routed over its\
   recovery LSP/span.  Note that in this case extra-traffic is still\
   allowed on the recovery LSP/span.\

RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   C. Freeze:\
\
   A configuration action, initiated externally, that prevents any\
   switch-over action from being taken, and, as such, freezes the\
   current state.\
\
   D. Forced switch-over for normal traffic:\
\
   A switch-over action, initiated externally, that switches normal\
   traffic to the recovery LSP/span, unless an equal or higher priority\
   switch-over command is in effect.\
\
   E. Manual switch-over for normal traffic:\
\
   A switch-over action, initiated externally, that switches normal\
   traffic to the recovery LSP/span, unless a fault condition exists on\
   other LSPs/spans (including the recovery LSP/span) or an equal or\
   higher priority switch-over command is in effect.\
\
   F. Manual switch-over for recovery LSP/span:\
\
   A switch-over action, initiated externally, that switches normal\
   traffic to the working LSP/span, unless a fault condition exists on\
   the working LSP/span or an equal or higher priority switch-over\
   command is in effect.\
\
   G. Clear:\
\
   An action, initiated externally, that clears the active external\
   command.\
\
4.14.  Unidirectional versus Bi-Directional Recovery Switching\
\
   A. Unidirectional recovery switching:\
\
   A recovery switching mode in which, for a unidirectional fault (i.e.,\
   a fault affecting only one direction of transmission), only the\
   normal traffic transported in the affected direction (of the LSP or\
   span) is switched to the recovery LSP/span.\
\
   B. Bi-directional recovery switching:\
\
   A recovery switching mode in which, for a unidirectional fault, the\
   normal traffic in both directions (of the LSP or span), including the\
   affected direction and the unaffected direction, are switched to the\
   recovery LSP/span.\

\
\
4.15.  Full versus Partial Span Recovery Switching\
\
   Bulk LSP recovery is initiated upon reception of either span failure\
   notification or bulk failure notification of the S LSPs carried by\
   this span.  In either case, the corresponding recovery switching\
   actions are performed at the LSP level, such that the ratio between\
   the number of recovery switching messages and the number of recovered\
   LSP (in one given direction) is minimized.  If this ratio equals 1,\
   one refers to full span recovery; otherwise, if this ratio is greater\
   than 1, one refers to partial span recovery.\
\
   A. Full Span Recovery\
\
   All the S LSP carried over a given span are recovered under span\
   failure condition.  Full span recovery is also referred to as "bulk\
   recovery".\
\
   B. Partial Span Recovery\
\
   Only a subset s of the S LSP carried over a given span is recovered\
   under span failure condition.  Both selection criteria of the\
   entities belonging to this subset, and the decision concerning the\
   recovery of the remaining (S - s) LSP, are based on local policy.\
\
4.16.  Recovery Schemes Related Time and Durations\
\
   This section gives several typical timing definitions that are of\
   importance for recovery schemes.\
\
   A. Detection time:\
\
   The time between the occurrence of the fault or degradation and its\
   detection.  Note that this is a rather theoretical time because, in\
   practice, this is difficult to measure.\
\
   B. Correlation time:\
\
   The time between the detection of the fault or degradation and the\
   reporting of the signal fail or degrade.  This time is typically used\
   in correlating related failures or degradations.\
\
   C. Notification time:\
\
   The time between the reporting of the signal fail or degrade and the\
   reception of the indication of this event by the entities that decide\
   on the recovery switching operation(s).\

\
RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
   D. Recovery Switching time:\
\
   The time between the initialization of the recovery switching\
   operation and the moment the normal traffic is selected from the\
   recovery LSP/span.\
\
   E. Total Recovery time:\
\
   The total recovery time is defined as the sum of the detection, the\
   correlation, the notification, and the recovery switching time.\
\
   F. Wait To Restore time:\
\
   A period of time that must elapse after a recovered fault before an\
   LSP/span can be used again to transport the normal traffic and/or to\
   select the normal traffic from.\
\
   Note: the hold-off time is defined as the time between the reporting\
   of signal fail or degrade, and the initialization of the recovery\
   switching operation.  This is useful when multiple layers of recovery\
   are being used.\
\
4.17.  Impairment\
\

\
   A network that is capable of restoring traffic in the event of a\
   failure.\
\
4.22.  Escalation\
\
   A network survivability action caused by the impossibility of the\
   survivability function in lower layers.\
\
5.  Recovery Phases\
\
   It is commonly accepted that recovery implies that the following\
   generic operations need to be performed when an LSP/span or a node\
   failure occurs:\
\
   - Phase 1: Failure Detection\
\
   The action of detecting the impairment (defect of performance\
   degradation) as a defect condition and the consequential activation\
   of SF or SD trigger to the control plane (through internal interface\
   with the transport plane).  Thus, failure detection (which should\
   occur at the transport layer closest to the failure) is the only\
   phase that cannot be achieved by the control plane alone.\
\
   - Phase 2: Failure Localization (and Isolation)\
\
   Failure localization provides, to the deciding entity, information\
   about the location (and thus the identity) of the transport plane\
   entity that causes the LSP(s)/span(s) failure.  The deciding entity\
   can then make an accurate decision to achieve finer grained recovery\
   switching action(s).\
\
   - Phase 3: Failure Notification\
\
   Failure notification phase is used 1) to inform intermediate nodes\
   that LSP(s)/span(s) failure has occurred and has been detected and 2)\
   to inform the recovery deciding entities (which can correspond to any\
   intermediate or end-point of the failed LSP/span) that the\
   corresponding LSP/span is not available.\
\
   - Phase 4: Recovery (Protection or Restoration)\
\
   See Section 4.3.\
\
   - Phase 5: Reversion (Normalization)\
\
   See Section 4.11.\

\
\
   The combination of Failure Detection and Failure Localization and\
   Notification is referred to as Fault Management.\
\
5.1.  Entities Involved During Recovery\
\
   The entities involved during the recovery operations can be defined\
   as follows; these entities are parts of ingress, egress, and\
   intermediate nodes, as defined previously:\
\
   A. Detecting Entity (Failure Detection):\
\
   An entity that detects a failure or group of failures; thus providing\
   a non-correlated list of failures.\
\
   B. Reporting Entity (Failure Correlation and Notification):\
\
   An entity that can make an intelligent decision on fault correlation\
   and report the failure to the deciding entity.  Fault reporting can\
   be automatically performed by the deciding entity detecting the\
   failure.\
\
   C. Deciding Entity (part of the failure recovery decision process):\
\
   An entity that makes the recovery decision or selects the recovery\
   resources.  This entity communicates the decision to the impacted\
   LSPs/spans with the recovery actions to be performed.\
\
   D. Recovering Entity (part of the failure recovery activation\
   process):\
\
   An entity that participates in the recovery of the LSPs/spans.\
\
   The process of moving failed LSPs from a failed (working) span to a\
   protection span must be initiated by one of the nodes that terminates\
   the span, e.g., A or B.  The deciding (and recovering) entity is\
   referred to as the "master", while the other node is called the\
   "slave" and corresponds to a recovering only entity.\
\
   Note: The determination of the master and the slave may be based on\
   configured information or protocol-specific requirements.\
\
6.  Protection Schemes\
\
   This section clarifies the multiple possible protection schemes and\
   the specific terminology for the protection.\

\
\
6.1.  1+1 Protection\
\
   1+1 protection has one working LSP/span, one protection LSP/span, and\
   a permanent bridge.  At the ingress node, the normal traffic is\
   permanently bridged to both the working and protection LSP/span.  At\
   the egress node, the normal traffic is selected from the better of\
   the two LSPs/spans.\
\
   Due to the permanent bridging, the 1+1 protection does not allow an\
   unprotected extra traffic signal to be provided.\
\
6.2.  1:N (N >= 1) Protection\
\
   1:N protection has N working LSPs/spans that carry normal traffic and\
   1 protection LSP/span that may carry extra-traffic.\
\
   At the ingress, the normal traffic is either permanently connected to\
   its working LSP/span and may be connected to the protection LSP/span\
   (case of broadcast bridge), or is connected to either its working\
   LSP/span or the protection LSP/span (case of selector bridge).  At\
   the egress node, the normal traffic is selected from either its\
   working or protection LSP/span.\
\
   Unprotected extra traffic can be transported over the protection\
   LSP/span whenever the protection LSP/span is not used to carry a\
   normal traffic.\
\
6.3.  M:N (M, N > 1, N >= M) Protection\
\
   M:N protection has N working LSPs/spans carrying normal traffic and M\
   protection LSP/span that may carry extra-traffic.\
\
   At the ingress, the normal traffic is either permanently connected to\
   its working LSP/span and may be connected to one of the protection\
   LSPs/spans (case of broadcast bridge), or is connected to either its\
   working LSP/span or one of the protection LSPs/spans (case of\
   selector bridge).  At the egress node, the normal traffic is selected\
   from either its working or one of the protection LSP/span.\
\
   Unprotected extra traffic can be transported over the M protection\
   LSP/span whenever the protection LSPs/spans is not used to carry a\
   normal traffic.\

\
\
6.4.  Notes on Protection Schemes\
\
   All protection types are either uni- or bi-directional; obviously,\
   the latter applies only to bi-directional LSPs/spans and requires\
   coordination between the ingress and egress node during protection\
   switching.\
\
   All protection types except 1+1 unidirectional protection switching\
   require a communication channel between the ingress and the egress\
   node.\
\
   In the GMPLS context, span protection refers to the full or partial\
   span recovery of the LSPs carried over that span (see Section 4.15).\
\
7.  Restoration Schemes\
\
   This section clarifies the multiple possible restoration schemes and\
   the specific terminology for the restoration.\
\
7.1.  Pre-Planned LSP Restoration\
\
   Also referred to as pre-planned LSP re-routing.  Before failure\
   detection and/or notification, one or more restoration LSPs are\
   instantiated between the same ingress-egress node pair as the working\
   LSP.  Note that the restoration resources must be pre-computed, must\
   be signaled, and may be selected a priori, but may not cross-\
   connected.  Thus, the restoration LSP is not able to carry any\
   extra-traffic.\
\
   The complete establishment of the restoration LSP (i.e., activation)\
   occurs only after failure detection and/or notification of the\
   working LSP and requires some additional restoration signaling.\
   Therefore, this mechanism protects against working LSP failure(s) but\
   requires activation of the restoration LSP after failure occurrence.\
   After the ingress node has activated the restoration LSP, the latter\
   can carry the normal traffic.\
\
   Note: when each working LSP is recoverable by exactly one restoration\
   LSP, one refers also to 1:1 (pre-planned) re-routing without extra-\
   traffic.\
\
7.1.1.  Shared-Mesh Restoration\
\
   "Shared-mesh" restoration is defined as a particular case of pre-\
   planned LSP re-routing that reduces the restoration resource\
   requirements by allowing multiple restoration LSPs (initiated from\
   distinct ingress nodes) to share common resources (including links\
   and nodes.)\

\
RFC 4427               GMPLS Recovery Terminology             March 2006\
\
\
7.2.  LSP Restoration\
\
   Also referred to as LSP re-routing.  The ingress node switches the\
   normal traffic to an alternate LSP that is signaled and fully\
   established (i.e., cross-connected) after failure detection and/or\
   notification.  The alternate LSP path may be computed after failure\
   detection and/or notification.  In this case, one also refers to\
   "Full LSP Re-routing."\
\
   The alternate LSP is signaled from the ingress node and may reuse the\
   intermediate node's resources of the working LSP under failure\
   condition (and may also include additional intermediate nodes.)\
\
7.2.1.  Hard LSP Restoration\
\
   Also referred to as hard LSP re-routing.  A re-routing operation\
   where the LSP is released before the full establishment of an\
   alternate LSP (i.e., break-before-make).\
\
7.2.2.  Soft LSP Restoration\
\
   Also referred to as soft LSP re-routing.  A re-routing operation\
   where the LSP is released after the full establishment of an\
   alternate LSP (i.e., make-before-break).\

RFC 4429                     Optimistic DAD                   April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is a modification of the\
   existing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC2461] and Stateless Address\
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC2462] processes.  The intention is to\
   minimize address configuration delays in the successful case, and to\
   reduce disruption as far as possible in the failure case.\
\
   Optimistic DAD is a useful optimization because in most cases DAD is\
   far more likely to succeed than fail.  This is discussed further in\
   Appendix A.  Disruption is minimized by limiting nodes' participation\
   in Neighbor Discovery while their addresses are still Optimistic.\
\
   It is not the intention of this memo to improve the security,\
   reliability, or robustness of DAD beyond that of existing standards,\
   but merely to provide a method to make it faster.\
\
1.1.  Problem Statement\
\
   The existing IPv6 address configuration mechanisms provide adequate\
   collision detection mechanisms for the fixed hosts they were designed\
   for.  However, a growing population of nodes need to maintain\
   continuous network access despite frequently changing their network\
   attachment.  Optimizations to the DAD process are required to provide\
   these nodes with sufficiently fast address configuration.\
\
   An optimized DAD method needs to:\
\
   * provide interoperability with nodes using the current standards.\
\
   * remove the RetransTimer delay during address configuration.\
\
   * ensure that the probability of address collision is not increased.\
\
   * improve the resolution mechanisms for address collisions.\
\
   * minimize disruption in the case of a collision.\
\
   It is not sufficient to merely reduce RetransTimer in order to reduce\
   the handover delay, as values of RetransTimer long enough to\
   guarantee detection of a collision are too long to avoid disruption\
   of time-critical services.\

\
1.2.  Definitions\
\
   Definitions of requirements keywords ('MUST NOT', 'SHOULD NOT',\
   'MAY', 'SHOULD', 'MUST') are in accordance with the IETF Best Current\
   Practice, RFC 2119 [RFC2119]\
\
   Address Resolution - Process defined by [RFC2461], section 7.2.\
\
   Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) - Process defined by\
        [RFC2461], section 7.3.\
\
   Standard Node - A Standard Node is one that is compliant with\
        [RFC2461] and [RFC2462].\
\
   Optimistic Node (ON) - An Optimistic Node is one that is compliant\
        with the rules specified in this memo.\
\
   Link - A communication facility or medium over which nodes can\
        communicate at the link layer.\
\
   Neighbors - Nodes on the same link, which may therefore be competing\
        for the same IP addresses.\
\
1.3.  Address Types\
\
   Tentative address (as per [RFC2462]) - an address whose uniqueness on\
        a link is being verified, prior to its assignment to an\
        interface.  A Tentative address is not considered assigned to an\
        interface in the usual sense.  An interface discards received\
        packets addressed to a Tentative address, but accepts Neighbor\
        Discovery packets related to Duplicate Address Detection for the\
        Tentative address.\
\
   Optimistic address - an address that is assigned to an interface and\
        available for use, subject to restrictions, while its uniqueness\
        on a link is being verified.  This memo introduces the\
        Optimistic state and defines its behaviors and restrictions.\
\
   Preferred address (as per [RFC2462]) - an address assigned to an\
        interface whose use by upper-layer protocols is unrestricted.\
        Preferred addresses may be used as the source (or destination)\
        address of packets sent from (or to) the interface.\

\
\
   Deprecated address (as per [RFC2462]) - An address assigned to an\
        interface whose use is discouraged, but not forbidden.  A\
        Deprecated address should no longer be used as a source address\
        in new communications, but packets sent from or to Deprecated\
        addresses are delivered as expected.  A Deprecated address may\
        continue to be used as a source address in communications where\
        switching to a Preferred address causes hardship to a specific\
        upper-layer activity (e.g., an existing TCP connection).\

\
2.  Optimistic DAD Behaviors\
\
   This non-normative section discusses Optimistic DAD behaviors.\
\
2.1.  Optimistic Addresses\
\
   [RFC2462] introduces the concept of Tentative (in 5.4) and Deprecated\
   (in 5.5.4) addresses.  Addresses that are neither are said to be\
   Preferred.  Tentative addresses may not be used for communication,\
   and Deprecated addresses should not be used for new communications.\
   These address states may also be used by other standards documents,\
   for example, Default Address Selection [RFC3484].\
\
   This memo introduces a new address state, 'Optimistic', that is used\
   to mark an address that is available for use but that has not\
   completed DAD.\
\
   Unless noted otherwise, components of the IPv6 protocol stack should\
   treat addresses in the Optimistic state equivalently to those in the\
   Deprecated state, indicating that the address is available for use\
   but should not be used if another suitable address is available.  For\
   example, Default Address Selection [RFC3484] uses the address state\
   to decide which source address to use for an outgoing packet.\
   Implementations should treat an address in state Optimistic as if it\
   were in state Deprecated.  If address states are recorded as\
   individual flags, this can easily be achieved by also setting\
   'Deprecated' when 'Optimistic' is set.\
\
   It is important to note that the address lifetime rules of [RFC2462]\
   still apply, and so an address may be Deprecated as well as\
   Optimistic.  When DAD completes without incident, the address becomes\
   either a Preferred or a Deprecated address, as per [RFC2462].\
\
2.2.  Avoiding Disruption\
\
   In order to avoid interference, it is important that an Optimistic\
   Node does not send any messages from an Optimistic Address that will\
   override its neighbors' Neighbor Cache (NC) entries for the address\
   it is trying to configure: doing so would disrupt the rightful owner\
   of the address in the case of a collision.\
\
   This is achieved by:\
\
   * Clearing the 'Override' flag in Neighbor Advertisements for\
        Optimistic Addresses, which prevents neighbors from overriding\
        their existing NC entries.  The 'Override' flag is already\
        defined [RFC2461] and used for Proxy Neighbor Advertisement.\

RFC 4429                     Optimistic DAD                   April 2006\
\
\
   * Never sending Neighbor Solicitations from an Optimistic Address.\
        NSes include a Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO), which\
        may cause Neighbor Cache disruption.  NSes sent as part of DAD\
        are sent from the unspecified address, without a SLLAO.\
\
   * Never using an Optimistic Address as the source address of a Router\
        Solicitation with a SLLAO.  Another address, or the unspecified\
        address, may be used, or the RS may be sent without a SLLAO.\
\
   An address collision with a router may cause a neighboring router's\
   IsRouter flags for that address to be cleared.  However, routers do\
   not appear to use the IsRouter flag for anything, and the NA sent in\
   response to the collision will reassert the IsRouter flag.\
\
2.3.  Router Redirection\
\
   Neighbor Solicitations cannot be sent from Optimistic Addresses, and\
   so an ON cannot directly contact a neighbor that is not already in\
   its Neighbor Cache.  Instead, the ON forwards packets via its default\
   router, relying on the router to forward the packets to their\
   destination.  In accordance with RFC 2461, the router should then\
   provide the ON with an ICMP Redirect, which may include a Target\
   Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO).  If it does, this will update the\
   ON's NC, and direct communication can begin.  If it does not, packets\
   continue to be forwarded via the router until the ON has a non-\
   Optimistic address from which to send an NS.\
\
2.4.  Contacting the Router\
\
   Generally, an RA will include a SLLAO, however this "MAY be omitted\
   to facilitate in-bound load balancing over replicated interfaces"\
   [RFC2461].  A node with only Optimistic Addresses is unable to\
   determine the router's Link-Layer Address as it can neither send an\
   RS to request a unicast RA, nor send an NS to request an NA.  In this\
   case, the ON will be unable to communicate with the router until at\
   least one of its addresses is no longer Optimistic.\

3.  Modifications to RFC-Mandated Behavior\
\
   All normative text in this memo is contained in this section.\
\
3.1.  General\
\
   * Optimistic DAD SHOULD only be used when the implementation is aware\
        that the address is based on a most likely unique interface\
        identifier (such as in [RFC2464]), generated randomly [RFC3041],\
        or by a well-distributed hash function [RFC3972] or assigned by\
        Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315].\
        Optimistic DAD SHOULD NOT be used for manually entered\
        addresses.\
\
3.2.  Modifications to RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery\
\
   * (modifies section 6.3.7)  A node MUST NOT send a Router\
        Solicitation with a SLLAO from an Optimistic Address.  Router\
        Solicitations SHOULD be sent from a non-Optimistic or the\
        Unspecified Address; however, they MAY be sent from an\
        Optimistic Address as long as the SLLAO is not included.\
\
   * (modifies section 7.2.2)  A node MUST NOT use an Optimistic Address\
        as the source address of a Neighbor Solicitation.\
\
   * If the ON isn't told the SLLAO of the router in an RA, and it\
        cannot determine this information without breaching the rules\
        above, it MUST leave the address Tentative until DAD completes\
        despite being unable to send any packets to the router.\
\
   * (modifies section 7.2.2)  When a node has a unicast packet to send\
        from an Optimistic Address to a neighbor, but does not know the\
        neighbor's link-layer address, it MUST NOT perform Address\
        Resolution.  It SHOULD forward the packet to a default router on\
        the link in the hope that the packet will be redirected.\
        Otherwise, it SHOULD buffer the packet until DAD is complete.\

\
\
3.3 Modifications to RFC 2462 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\
\
   * (modifies section 5.5) A host MAY choose to configure a new address\
        as an Optimistic Address.  A host that does not know the SLLAO\
        of its router SHOULD NOT configure a new address as Optimistic.\
        A router SHOULD NOT configure an Optimistic Address.\
\
   * (modifies section 5.4.2) The host MUST join the all-nodes multicast\
        address and the solicited-node multicast address of the\
        Tentative address.  The host SHOULD NOT delay before sending\
        Neighbor Solicitation messages.\
\
   * (modifies section 5.4) The Optimistic Address is configured and\
        available for use on the interface immediately.  The address\
        MUST be flagged as 'Optimistic'.\
\
   * When DAD completes for an Optimistic Address, the address is no\
        longer Optimistic and it becomes Preferred or Deprecated\
        according to the rules of RFC 2462.\
\
   * (modifies section 5.4.3) The node MUST NOT reply to a Neighbor\
        Solicitation for an Optimistic Address from the unspecified\
        address.  Receipt of such an NS indicates that the address is a\
        duplicate, and it MUST be deconfigured as per the behaviour\
        specified in RFC 2462 for Tentative addresses.\
\
   * (modifies section 5.4.3) The node MUST reply to a Neighbor\
        Solicitation for an Optimistic Address from a unicast address,\
        but the reply MUST have the Override flag cleared (O=0).\

\
\
4.  Protocol Operation\
\
   This non-normative section provides clarification of the interactions\
   between Optimistic Nodes, and between Optimistic Nodes and Standard\
   Nodes.\
\
   The following cases all consider an Optimistic Node (ON) receiving a\
   Router Advertisement containing a new prefix and deciding to\
   autoconfigure a new Optimistic Address on that prefix.\
\
   The ON will immediately send out a Neighbor Solicitation to determine\
   if its new Optimistic Address is already in use.\
\
4.1.  Simple Case\
\
   In the non-collision case, the Optimistic Address being configured by\
   the new node is unused and not present in the Neighbor Caches of any\
   of its neighbors.\
\
   There will be no response to its NS (sent from ::), and this NS will\
   not modify the state of neighbors' Neighbor Caches.\
\
   The ON already has the link-layer address of the router (from the\
   RA), and the router can determine the link-layer address of the ON\
   through standard Address Resolution.  Communications can begin as\
   soon as the router and the ON have each other's link-layer addresses.\
\
   After the appropriate DAD delay has completed, the address is no\
   longer Optimistic, and becomes either Preferred or Deprecated as per\
   RFC 2462.\
\
4.2.  Collision Case\
\
   In the collision case, the Optimistic Address being configured by the\
   new node is already in use by another node, and present in the\
   Neighbor Caches (NCs) of neighbors that are communicating with this\
   node.\
\
   The NS sent by the ON has the unspecified source address, ::, and no\
   SLLAO.  This NS will not cause changes to the NC entries of\
   neighboring hosts.\
\
   The ON will hopefully already know all it needs to about the router\
   from the initial RA.  However, if it needs to it can still send an RS\
   to ask for more information, but it may not include a SLLAO.  This\
   forces an all-nodes multicast response from the router, but will not\
   disrupt other nodes' NCs.\

RFC 4429                     Optimistic DAD                   April 2006\
\
\
   In the course of establishing connections, the ON might have sent NAs\
   in response to received NSes.  Since NAs sent from Optimistic\
   Addresses have O=0, they will not have overridden existing NC\
   entries, although they may have resulted in a colliding entry being\
   changed to state STALE.  This change is recoverable through standard\
   NUD.\
\
   When an NA is received from the collidee defending the address, the\
   ON immediately stops using the address and deconfigures it.\
\
   Of course, in the meantime the ON may have sent packets that identify\
   it as the owner of its new Optimistic Address (for example, Binding\
   Updates in Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]).  This may incur some penalty to\
   the ON, in the form of broken connections, and some penalty to the\
   rightful owner of the address, since it will receive (and potentially\
   reply to) the misdirected packets.  It is for this reason that\
   Optimistic DAD should be used only where the probability of collision\
   is very low.\
\
4.3.  Interoperation Cases\
\
   Once the Optimistic Address has completed DAD, it acts exactly like a\
   normal address, and so interoperation cases only arise while the\
   address is Optimistic.\
\
   If an ON attempts to configure an address currently Tentatively\
   assigned to a Standard Node, the Standard Node will see the Neighbor\
   Solicitation and deconfigure the address.\
\
   If a node attempts to configure an ON's Optimistic Address, the ON\
   will see the NS and deconfigure the address.\
\
4.4.  Pathological Cases\
\
   Optimistic DAD suffers from similar problems to Standard DAD; for\
   example, duplicates are not guaranteed to be detected if packets are\
   lost.\
\
   These problems exist, and are not gracefully recoverable, in Standard\
   DAD.  Their probability in both Optimistic and Standard DAD can be\
   reduced by increasing the RFC 2462 DupAddrDetectTransmits variable to\
   greater than 1.\
\
   This version of Optimistic DAD is dependent on the details of the\
   router behavior, e.g., that the router includes SLLAOs in RAs and\
   that the router is willing to redirect traffic for the ON.  Where the\
   router does not behave in this way, the behavior of Optimistic DAD\
   inherently reverts to that of Standard DAD.\

\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   There are existing security concerns with Neighbor Discovery and\
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, and this memo does not purport\
   to fix them.  However, this memo does not significantly increase\
   security concerns either.\
\
   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] provides protection\
   against the threats to Neighbor Discovery described in [RFC3756].\
   Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection does not introduce any\
   additional threats to Neighbor Discovery if SEND is used.\
\
   Optimistic DAD takes steps to ensure that if another node is already\
   using an address, the proper link-layer address in existing Neighbor\
   Cache entries is not replaced with the link-layer address of the\
   Optimistic Node.  However, there are still scenarios where incorrect\
   entries may be created, if only temporarily.  For example, if a\
   router (while forwarding a packet) sends out a Neighbor Solicitation\
   for an address, the Optimistic Node may respond first, and if the\
   router has no pre-existing link-layer address for that IP address, it\
   will accept the response and (incorrectly) forward any queued packets\
   to the Optimistic Node.  The Optimistic Node may then respond in an\
   incorrect manner (e.g., sending a TCP RST in response to an unknown\
   TCP connection).  Such transient conditions should be short-lived, in\
   most cases.\
\
   Likewise, an Optimistic Node can still inject IP packets into the\
   Internet that will in effect be "spoofed" packets appearing to come\
   from the legitimate node.  In some cases, those packets may lead to\
   errors or other operational problems, though one would expect that\
   upper-layer protocols would generally treat such packets robustly, in\
   the same way they must treat old and other duplicate packets.\

\
\
Appendix A.  Probability of Collision\
\
   In assessing the usefulness of Duplicate Address Detection, the\
   probability of collision must be considered.  Various mechanisms such\
   as SLAAC [RFC2462] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] attempt to guarantee the\
   uniqueness of the address.  The uniqueness of SLAAC depends on the\
   reliability of the manufacturing process (so that duplicate L2\
   addresses are not assigned) and human factors if L2 addresses can be\
   manually assigned.  The uniqueness of DHCPv6-assigned addresses\
   relies on the correctness of implementation to ensure that no two\
   nodes can be given the same address.\
\
   "Privacy Extensions to SLAAC" [RFC3041] avoids these potential error\
   cases by picking an Interface Identifier (IID) at random from 2^62\
   possible 64-bit IIDs (allowing for the reserved U and G bits).  No\
   attempt is made to guarantee uniqueness, but the probability can be\
   easily estimated, and as the following discussion shows, probability\
   of collision is exceedingly small.\
\
A.1.  The Birthday Paradox\
\
   When considering collision probability, the Birthday Paradox is\
   generally mentioned.  When randomly selecting k values from n\
   possibilities, the probability of two values being the same is:\
\
           Pb(n,k) = 1-( n! / [ (n-k)! . n^k] )\
\
   Calculating the probability of collision with this method is\
   difficult, however, as one of the terms is n!, and (2^62)! is an\
   unwieldy number.  We can, however, calculate an upper bound for the\
   probability of collision:\
\
           Pb(n,k) <= 1-( [(n-k+1)/n] ^ [k-1] )\
\
   which lets us calculate that even for large networks the probability\
   of any two nodes colliding is very small indeed:\
\
           Pb(2^62,    500) <= 5.4e-14\
           Pb(2^62,   5000) <= 5.4e-12\
           Pb(2^62,  50000) <= 5.4e-10\
           Pb(2^62, 500000) <= 5.4e-08\
\
   The upper-bound formula used above was taken from "Random Generation\
   of Interface Identifiers", by M. Bagnulo, I. Soto, A. Garcia-\
   Martinez, and A. Azcorra, and is used with the kind permission of the\
   authors.\

\
\
A.2.  Individual Nodes\
\
   When considering the effect of collisions on an individual node, we\
   do not need to consider the Birthday Paradox.  When a node moves into\
   a network with K existing nodes, the probability that it will not\
   collide with any of the distinct addresses in use is simply 1-K/N.\
   If it moves to such networks M times, the probability that it will\
   not cause a collision on any of those moves is (1-K/N)^M; thus, the\
   probability of it causing at least one collision is:\
\
           Pc(n,k,m) = 1-[(1-k/n)^m]\
\
   Even considering a very large number of moves (m = 600000, slightly\
   more than one move per minute for one year) and rather crowded\
   networks (k=50000 nodes per network), the odds of collision for a\
   given node are vanishingly small:\
\
           Pc(2^62,  5000,   600000)     = 6.66e-10\
           Pc(2^62, 50000,   600000)     = 6.53e-09\
\
   Each such collision affects two nodes, so the probability of being\
   affected by a collision is twice this.  Even if the node moves into\
   networks of 50000 nodes once per minute for 100 years, the\
   probability of it causing or suffering a collision at any point are a\
   little over 1 in a million.\
\
           Pc(2^62, 50000, 60000000) * 2 = 1.3e-06\

Abstract\
\
   This memo describes a key-exchange method for the Secure Shell (SSH)\
   protocol based on Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption.\
   It uses much less client CPU time than the Diffie-Hellman algorithm\
   specified as part of the core protocol, and hence is particularly\
   suitable for slow client systems.\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.  The\
   core protocol uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  On slow CPUs, this\
   key exchange can take tens of seconds to complete, which can be\
   irritating for the user.  A previous version of the SSH protocol,\
   described in [SSH1], uses a key-exchange method based on\
   Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption, which consumes an\
   order of magnitude less CPU time on the client, and hence is\
   particularly suitable for slow client systems such as mobile devices.\
   This memo describes a key-exchange mechanism for the version of SSH\
   described in [RFC4251] that is similar to that used by the older\
   version, and about as fast, while retaining the security advantages\
   of the newer protocol.\

\
2.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST" and "SHOULD" in this document are to be\
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
   The data types "byte", "string", and "mpint" are defined in Section 5\
   of [RFC4251].\
\
   Other terminology and symbols have the same meaning as in [RFC4253].\
\
3.  Overview\
\
   The RSA key-exchange method consists of three messages.  The server\
   sends to the client an RSA public key, K_T, to which the server holds\
   the private key.  This may be a transient key generated solely for\
   this SSH connection, or it may be re-used for several connections.\
   The client generates a string of random bytes, K, encrypts it using\
   K_T, and sends the result back to the server, which decrypts it.  The\
   client and server each hash K, K_T, and the various key-exchange\
   parameters to generate the exchange hash, H, which is used to\
   generate the encryption keys for the session, and the server signs H\
   with its host key and sends the signature to the client.  The client\
   then verifies the host key as described in Section 8 of [RFC4253].\
\
   This method provides explicit server identification as defined in\
   Section 7 of [RFC4253].  It requires a signature-capable host key.\
\
4.  Details\
\
   The RSA key-exchange method has the following parameters:\
\
       HASH     hash algorithm for calculating exchange hash, etc.\
       HLEN     output length of HASH in bits\
       MINKLEN  minimum transient RSA modulus length in bits\
\
   Their values are defined in Section 5 and Section 6 for the two\
   methods defined by this document.\
\
   The method uses the following messages.\
\
   First, the server sends:\
\
       byte      SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_PUBKEY\
       string    server public host key and certificates (K_S)\
       string    K_T, transient RSA public key\

RFC 4432                  SSH RSA Key Exchange                March 2006\
\
\
   The key K_T is encoded according to the "ssh-rsa" scheme described in\
   Section 6.6 of [RFC4253].  Note that unlike an "ssh-rsa" host key,\
   K_T is used only for encryption, and not for signature.  The modulus\
   of K_T MUST be at least MINKLEN bits long.\
\
   The client generates a random integer, K, in the range\
   0 <= K < 2^(KLEN-2*HLEN-49), where KLEN is the length of the modulus\
   of K_T, in bits.  The client then uses K_T to encrypt:\
\
       mpint     K, the shared secret\
\
   The encryption is performed according to the RSAES-OAEP scheme of\
   [RFC3447], with a mask generation function of MGF1-with-HASH, a hash\
   of HASH, and an empty label.  See Appendix A for a proof that the\
   encoding of K is always short enough to be thus encrypted.  Having\
   performed the encryption, the client sends:\
\
       byte      SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_SECRET\
       string    RSAES-OAEP-ENCRYPT(K_T, K)\
\
   Note that the last stage of RSAES-OAEP-ENCRYPT is to encode an\
   integer as an octet string using the I2OSP primitive of [RFC3447].\
   This, combined with encoding the result as an SSH "string", gives a\
   result that is similar, but not identical, to the SSH "mpint"\
   encoding applied to that integer.  This is the same encoding as is\
   used by "ssh-rsa" signatures in [RFC4253].\
\
   The server decrypts K.  If a decryption error occurs, the server\
   SHOULD send SSH_MESSAGE_DISCONNECT with a reason code of\
   SSH_DISCONNECT_KEY_EXCHANGE_FAILED and MUST disconnect.  Otherwise,\
   the server responds with:\
\
       byte      SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_DONE\
       string    signature of H with host key\
\
   The hash H is computed as the HASH hash of the concatenation of the\
   following:\
\
       string    V_C, the client's identification string\
                 (CR and LF excluded)\
       string    V_S, the server's identification string\
                 (CR and LF excluded)\
       string    I_C, the payload of the client's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT\
       string    I_S, the payload of the server's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT\
       string    K_S, the host key\
       string    K_T, the transient RSA key\
       string    RSAES_OAEP_ENCRYPT(K_T, K), the encrypted secret\
       mpint     K, the shared secret\

\
\
   This value is called the exchange hash, and it is used to\
   authenticate the key exchange.  The exchange hash SHOULD be kept\
   secret.\
\
   The signature algorithm MUST be applied over H, not the original\
   data.  Most signature algorithms include hashing and additional\
   padding.  For example, "ssh-dss" specifies SHA-1 hashing.  In such\
   cases, the data is first hashed with HASH to compute H, and H is then\
   hashed again as part of the signing operation.\
\
5.  rsa1024-sha1\
\
   The "rsa1024-sha1" method specifies RSA key exchange as described\
   above with the following parameters:\
\
       HASH     SHA-1, as defined in [RFC3174]\
       HLEN     160\
       MINKLEN  1024\
\
6.  rsa2048-sha256\
\
   The "rsa2048-sha256" method specifies RSA key exchange as described\
   above with the following parameters:\
\
       HASH     SHA-256, as defined in [FIPS-180-2]\
       HLEN     256\
       MINKLEN  2048\
\
7.  Message Numbers\
\
   The following message numbers are defined:\
\
       SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_PUBKEY  30\
       SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_SECRET  31\
       SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_DONE    32\
\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   The security considerations in [RFC4251] apply.\
\
   If the RSA private key generated by the server is revealed, then the\
   session key is revealed.  The server should thus arrange to erase\
   this from memory as soon as it is no longer required.  If the same\
   RSA key is used for multiple SSH connections, an attacker who can\
   find the private key (either by factorising the public key or by\
   other means) will gain access to all of the sessions that used that\
   key.  As a result, servers SHOULD use each RSA key for as few key\
   exchanges as possible.\

RFC 4432                  SSH RSA Key Exchange                March 2006\
\
\
   [RFC3447] recommends that RSA keys used with RSAES-OAEP not be used\
   with other schemes, or with RSAES-OAEP using a different hash\
   function.  In particular, this means that K_T should not be used as a\
   host key, or as a server key in earlier versions of the SSH protocol.\
\
   Like all key-exchange mechanisms, this one depends for its security\
   on the randomness of the secrets generated by the client (the random\
   number K) and the server (the transient RSA private key).  In\
   particular, it is essential that the client use a high-quality\
   cryptographic pseudo-random number generator to generate K.  Using a\
   bad random number generator will allow an attacker to break all the\
   encryption and integrity protection of the Secure Shell transport\
   layer.  See [RFC4086] for recommendations on random number\
   generation.\
\
   The size of transient key used should be sufficient to protect the\
   encryption and integrity keys generated by the key-exchange method.\
   For recommendations on this, see [RFC3766].  The strength of\
   RSAES-OAEP is in part dependent on the hash function it uses.\
   [RFC3447] suggests using a hash with an output length of twice the\
   security level required, so SHA-1 is appropriate for applications\
   requiring up to 80 bits of security, and SHA-256 for those requiring\
   up to 128 bits.\
\
   Unlike the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange method defined by [RFC4253],\
   this method allows the client to fully determine the shared secret,\
   K.  This is believed not to be significant, since K is only ever used\
   when hashed with data provided in part by the server (usually in the\
   form of the exchange hash, H).  If an extension to SSH were to use K\
   directly and to assume that it had been generated by Diffie-Hellman\
   key exchange, this could produce a security weakness.  Protocol\
   extensions using K directly should be viewed with extreme suspicion.\
\
   This key-exchange method is designed to be resistant to collision\
   attacks on the exchange hash, by ensuring that neither side is able\
   to freely choose its input to the hash after seeing all of the other\
   side's input.  The server's last input is in SSH_MSG_KEXRSA_PUBKEY,\
   before it has seen the client's choice of K.  The client's last input\
   is K and its RSA encryption, and the one-way nature of RSA encryption\
   should ensure that the client cannot choose K so as to cause a\
   collision.\
\
9.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has assigned the names "rsa1024-sha1" and "rsa2048-sha256" as\
   Key Exchange Method Names in accordance with [RFC4250].\

\
Appendix A.  On the Size of K\
\
   The requirements on the size of K are intended to ensure that it is\
   always possible to encrypt it under K_T.  The mpint encoding of K\
   requires a leading zero bit, padding to a whole number of bytes, and\
   a four-byte length field, giving a maximum length in bytes,\
   B = (KLEN-2*HLEN-49+1+7)/8 + 4 = (KLEN-2*HLEN-9)/8 (where "/" denotes\
   integer division rounding down).\
\
   The maximum length of message that can be encrypted using RSAEP-OAEP\
   is defined by [RFC3447] in terms of the key length in bytes, which is\
   (KLEN+7)/8.  The maximum length is thus L = (KLEN+7-2*HLEN-16)/8 =\
   (KLEN-2*HLEN-9)/8.  Thus, the encoded version of K is always small\
   enough to be encrypted under K_T.\

Abstract\
\
   This document is an addendum to RFC 4348, which specifies the RTP\
   payload format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB)\
   speech codec.  This document specifies some updates in RFC 4348 to\
   enable support for the new operating mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e.,\
   VMR-WB mode 4).  These updates do not affect the existing modes of\
   VMR-WB already specified in RFC 4348.\
\
   The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all\
   provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc., that are\
   specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to the new operating mode with\
   no exception.\

RFC 4424          VMR-WB Extension RTP Payload Format      February 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document is an addendum to RFC 4348 [2] and contains the\
   necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2\
   VMR-WB standard [1].  The new mode of VMR-WB standard (VMR-WB mode\
   4), although operating at a lower data rate, has similar\
   characteristics and functionalities compared to the existing modes of\
   VMR-WB already included in RFC 4348 (e.g., variable bit rate,\
   narrowband/wideband input/output speech/audio processing capability,\
   continuous and discontinuous transmission, etc.).  Therefore, all\
   provisions and restrictions specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to\
   all modes of the VMR-WB standard including the new mode, which is\
   specified in this document.  As a result, no new media type\
   registration is required.\
\
   The VMR-WB file format for transport of VMR-WB speech data in storage\
   mode applications is specified in [1,4] and includes support for the\
   new mode of operation.\
\
   The following sections provide the necessary updates to RFC 4348 to\
   enable support of VMR-WB mode 4.\
\
2.  Conventions and Acronyms\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].\
\
   The following acronyms are used in this document:\
\
      3GPP2  - Third Generation Partnership Project 2\
      CDMA   - Code Division Multiple Access\
      VMR-WB - Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband\
      CMR    - Codec Mode Request\
      DTX    - Discontinuous Transmission\
      RTP    - Real-Time Transport Protocol\
      MIME   - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\
\
3.  The Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Extension\
\
   VMR-WB is the wideband speech-coding standard developed by the Third\
   Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for encoding/decoding\
   wideband/narrowband speech content in multimedia services in 3G CDMA\
   cellular systems [1].  VMR-WB is a source-controlled variable-rate\
   multimode wideband speech codec.  It has a number of operating modes,\
   where each mode is a trade-off between voice quality and average data\
   rate.  The operating mode in VMR-WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen\
   based on the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality\
\

RFC 4424          VMR-WB Extension RTP Payload Format      February 2006\
\
\
   of service.  The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode is\
   obtained by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown in\
   Tables 1 and 3) compliant with CDMA2000 system depending on the\
   instantaneous characteristics of input speech and the maximum and\
   minimum rate constraints imposed by the network operator.\
\
   The capabilities of the VMR-WB codec were extended through the\
   addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates,\
   resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non-IP networks [1].\
\
   As a result of this extension, certain reserved table entries in RFC\
   4348 are used to include support for the new operating mode.  VMR-WB\
   mode 4 is compliant with all applicable provisions and restrictions\
   specified in RFC 4348 [2].  Note that the existing table entries of\
   RFC 4348 remain unchanged (e.g., frame types) and the original modes\
   of VMR-WB are not affected by these updates.\
\
   The existing flexibility in RFC 4348 for future extensions allows the\
   addition of the new mode without any impact on the interoperability\
   with earlier implementations of RFC 4348.\
\
   The following sections provide the necessary updates that are\
   required to be made in RFC 4348.\
\
   The provisions and considerations for implementation, congestion\
   control, and security remain identical to those specified in RFC\
   4348.\

   | Full-Rate with Bit Errors |      171        |     8.55      |\
   +---------------------------+-----------------+---------------+\
\
   Table 1: CDMA2000 system permissible frame types and their\
            associated encoding rates\
\
   Note that the new permissible rates correspond to CDMA2000 rate-set I\
   and have been added to the table.\
\
   Table 2 of RFC 4348 is updated as follows to include VMR-WB mode 4\
   and VMR-WB mode 4 with maximum half-rate similar to that described in\
   Section 2.4 of the revised VMR-WB specification [1].\

\
\
7.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document updates the media type registered in [2].  IANA has\
   added this document as reference to that media type registration and\
   has modified the optional parameter mode-set in the registration.\
   Section 9.1 of RFC 4348 [2] reads:\
\
                                     Currently, this list\
            includes modes 0, 1, 2, and 3 [1], but MAY be\
            extended in the future.  If such mode-set is\
            specified during session initiation, the encoder\
            MUST NOT use modes outside of the subset.  If not\
            present, all operating modes in the set 0 to 3 are\
            allowed for the session.\
\
   IANA will change "modes 0, 1, 2 and 3 [1]" to "modes 0, 1, 2, 3, and\
   4 [1] [2]", and change "modes in the set 0 to 3" to "modes in the set\
   0 to 4".  [1] will be the IANA's reference to the original VMR-WB\
   document (3GPP2 C.S0052-A v1.0) and [2] will be IANA's reference to\
   this document (RFC 4424).\

   DNSSEC [1] [2] [3] authenticates DNS data by building public-key\
   signature chains along the DNS delegation chain from a trust anchor,\
   ideally a trust anchor for the DNS root.\
\
   This document defines a new resource record for publishing such trust\
   anchors outside of the DNS's normal delegation chain.  Use of these\
   records by DNSSEC validators is outside the scope of this document,\
   but it is expected that these records will help resolvers validate\
   DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors either aren't signed or\
   refuse to publish delegation signer (DS) records for their children.\
\
2.  DLV Resource Record\
\
   The DLV resource record has exactly the same wire and presentation\
   formats as the DS resource record, defined in RFC 4034, Section 5.\
   It uses the same IANA-assigned values in the algorithm and digest\
   type fields as the DS record.  (Those IANA registries are known as\
   the "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" and "DS RR Type Algorithm\
   Numbers" registries.)\

RFC 4431                  DLV Resource Record              February 2006\
\
\
   The DLV record is a normal DNS record type without any special\
   processing requirements.  In particular, the DLV record does not\
   inherit any of the special processing or handling requirements of the\
   DS record type (described in Section 3.1.4.1 of RFC 4035).  Unlike\
   the DS record, the DLV record may not appear on the parent's side of\
   a zone cut.  A DLV record may, however, appear at the apex of a zone.\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   For authoritative servers and resolvers that do not attempt to use\
   DLV RRs as part of DNSSEC validation, there are no particular\
   security concerns -- DLV RRs are just like any other DNS data.\
\
   Software using DLV RRs as part of DNSSEC validation will almost\
   certainly want to impose constraints on their use, but those\
   constraints are best left to be described by the documents that more\
   fully describe the particulars of how the records are used.  At a\
   minimum, it would be unwise to use the records without some sort of\
   cryptographic authentication.  More likely than not, DNSSEC itself\
   will be used to authenticate the DLV RRs.  Depending on how a DLV RR\
   is used, failure to properly authenticate it could lead to\
   significant additional security problems including failure to detect\
   spoofed DNS data.\
\
   RFC 4034, Section 8, describes security considerations specific to\
   the DS RR.  Those considerations are equally applicable to DLV RRs.\
   Of particular note, the key tag field is used to help select DNSKEY\
   RRs efficiently, but it does not uniquely identify a single DNSKEY\
   RR.  It is possible for two distinct DNSKEY RRs to have the same\
   owner name, the same algorithm type, and the same key tag.  An\
   implementation that uses only the key tag to select a DNSKEY RR might\
   select the wrong public key in some circumstances.\
\
   For further discussion of the security implications of DNSSEC, see\
   RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035.\
\
4.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has assigned DNS type code 32769 to the DLV resource record from\
   the Specification Required portion of the DNS Resource Record Type\
   registry, as defined in [4].\
\
   The DLV resource record reuses the same algorithm and digest type\
   registries already used for the DS resource record, currently known\
   as the "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" and "DS RR Type Algorithm\
   Numbers" registries.\

RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive\
   public-key cryptosystem, in particular for mobile (i.e., wireless)\
   environments.  Compared to currently prevalent cryptosystems such as\
   RSA, ECC offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes.  This is\
   illustrated in the following table, based on [18], which gives\
   approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric- and asymmetric-key\
   cryptosystems based on the best-known algorithms for attacking them.\
\
                    Symmetric  |   ECC   |  DH/DSA/RSA\
                   ------------+---------+-------------\
                        80     |   163   |     1024\
                       112     |   233   |     2048\
                       128     |   283   |     3072\
                       192     |   409   |     7680\
                       256     |   571   |    15360\
\
                  Table 1: Comparable Key Sizes (in bits)\
\
   Smaller key sizes result in savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and\
   computational cost that make ECC especially attractive for\
   constrained environments.\
\
   This document describes additions to TLS to support ECC, applicable\
   both to TLS Version 1.0 [2] and to TLS Version 1.1 [3].  In\
   particular, it defines\
\
   o  the use of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement\
      scheme with long-term or ephemeral keys to establish the TLS\
      premaster secret, and\
\
   o  the use of fixed-ECDH certificates and ECDSA for authentication of\
      TLS peers.\
\
   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2\
   provides an overview of ECC-based key exchange algorithms for TLS.\
   Section 3 describes the use of ECC certificates for client\
   authentication.  TLS extensions that allow a client to negotiate the\
   use of specific curves and point formats are presented in Section 4.\
   Section 5 specifies various data structures needed for an ECC-based\
   handshake, their encoding in TLS messages, and the processing of\
   those messages.  Section 6 defines new ECC-based cipher suites and\
   identifies a small subset of these as recommended for all\
   implementations of this specification.  Section 7 discusses security\
   considerations.  Section 8 describes IANA considerations for the name\
   spaces created by this document.  Section 9 gives acknowledgements.\

   This is followed by the lists of normative and informative references\
   cited in this document, the authors' contact information, and\
   statements on intellectual property rights and copyrights.\
\
   Implementation of this specification requires familiarity with TLS\
   [2][3], TLS extensions [4], and ECC [5][6][7][11][17].\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\
\
2.  Key Exchange Algorithms\
\
   This document introduces five new ECC-based key exchange algorithms\
   for TLS.  All of them use ECDH to compute the TLS premaster secret,\
   and they differ only in the lifetime of ECDH keys (long-term or\
   ephemeral) and the mechanism (if any) used to authenticate them.  The\
   derivation of the TLS master secret from the premaster secret and the\
   subsequent generation of bulk encryption/MAC keys and initialization\
   vectors is independent of the key exchange algorithm and not impacted\
   by the introduction of ECC.\
\
   The table below summarizes the new key exchange algorithms, which\
   mimic DH_DSS, DHE_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_RSA, and DH_anon (see [2] and\
   [3]), respectively.\
\
          Key\
          Exchange\
          Algorithm           Description\
          ---------           -----------\
\
          ECDH_ECDSA          Fixed ECDH with ECDSA-signed certificates.\
\
          ECDHE_ECDSA         Ephemeral ECDH with ECDSA signatures.\
\
          ECDH_RSA            Fixed ECDH with RSA-signed certificates.\
\
          ECDHE_RSA           Ephemeral ECDH with RSA signatures.\
\
          ECDH_anon           Anonymous ECDH, no signatures.\
\
                     Table 2: ECC Key Exchange Algorithms\
\
   The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange mechanisms provide forward\
   secrecy.  With ECDHE_RSA, a server can reuse its existing RSA\
   certificate and easily comply with a constrained client's elliptic\
   curve preferences (see Section 4).  However, the computational cost\

RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
   incurred by a server is higher for ECDHE_RSA than for the traditional\
   RSA key exchange, which does not provide forward secrecy.\
\
   The ECDH_RSA mechanism requires a server to acquire an ECC\
   certificate, but the certificate issuer can still use an existing RSA\
   key for signing.  This eliminates the need to update the keys of\
   trusted certification authorities accepted by TLS clients.  The\
   ECDH_ECDSA mechanism requires ECC keys for the server as well as the\
   certification authority and is best suited for constrained devices\
   unable to support RSA.\
\
   The anonymous key exchange algorithm does not provide authentication\
   of the server or the client.  Like other anonymous TLS key exchanges,\
   it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.  Implementations of this\
   algorithm SHOULD provide authentication by other means.\
\
   Note that there is no structural difference between ECDH and ECDSA\
   keys.  A certificate issuer may use X.509 v3 keyUsage and\
   extendedKeyUsage extensions to restrict the use of an ECC public key\
   to certain computations [15].  This document refers to an ECC key as\
   ECDH-capable if its use in ECDH is permitted.  ECDSA-capable is\
   defined similarly.\

\
\
   Figure 1 shows all messages involved in the TLS key establishment\
   protocol (aka full handshake).  The addition of ECC has direct impact\
   only on the ClientHello, the ServerHello, the server's Certificate\
   message, the ServerKeyExchange, the ClientKeyExchange, the\
   CertificateRequest, the client's Certificate message, and the\
   CertificateVerify.  Next, we describe each ECC key exchange algorithm\
   in greater detail in terms of the content and processing of these\
   messages.  For ease of exposition, we defer discussion of client\
   authentication and associated messages (identified with a + in\
   Figure 1) until Section 3 and of the optional ECC-specific extensions\
   (which impact the Hello messages) until Section 4.\
\
2.1.  ECDH_ECDSA\
\
   In ECDH_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDH-capable\
   public key and be signed with ECDSA.\
\
   A ServerKeyExchange MUST NOT be sent (the server's certificate\
   contains all the necessary keying information required by the client\
   to arrive at the premaster secret).\
\
   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the\
   server's long-term public key and sends its public key in the\
   ClientKeyExchange message (except when using client authentication\
   algorithm ECDSA_fixed_ECDH or RSA_fixed_ECDH, in which case the\
   modifications from Section 3.2 or Section 3.3 apply).\
\
   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation and use the\
   resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.  All ECDH\
   calculations are performed as specified in Section 5.10.\
\
2.2.  ECDHE_ECDSA\
\
   In ECDHE_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDSA-\
   capable public key and be signed with ECDSA.\
\
   The server sends its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of\
   the corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These\
   parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the private key\
   corresponding to the public key in the server's Certificate.\
\
   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the\
   server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its public key in the\
   ClientKeyExchange message.\
\
   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation (Section 5.10) and\
   use the resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.\

\
\
2.3.  ECDH_RSA\
\
   This key exchange algorithm is the same as ECDH_ECDSA except that the\
   server's certificate MUST be signed with RSA rather than ECDSA.\
\
2.4.  ECDHE_RSA\
\
   This key exchange algorithm is the same as ECDHE_ECDSA except that\
   the server's certificate MUST contain an RSA public key authorized\
   for signing, and that the signature in the ServerKeyExchange message\
   must be computed with the corresponding RSA private key.  The server\
   certificate MUST be signed with RSA.\
\
2.5.  ECDH_anon\
\
   In ECDH_anon, the server's Certificate, the CertificateRequest, the\
   client's Certificate, and the CertificateVerify messages MUST NOT be\
   sent.\
\
   The server MUST send an ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification\
   of the corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These\
   parameters MUST NOT be signed.\
\
   The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the\
   server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its public key in the\
   ClientKeyExchange message.\
\
   Both client and server perform an ECDH operation and use the\
   resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.  All ECDH\
   calculations are performed as specified in Section 5.10.\
\
   Note that while the ECDH_ECDSA, ECDHE_ECDSA, ECDH_RSA, and ECDHE_RSA\
   key exchange algorithms require the server's certificate to be signed\
   with a particular signature scheme, this specification (following the\
   similar cases of DH_DSS, DHE_DSS, DH_RSA, and DHE_RSA in [2] and [3])\
   does not impose restrictions on signature schemes used elsewhere in\
   the certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and\
   it is expected that this will be taken into account in certification\
   authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are not\
   strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities\
   of a client to completely validate a given chain, the client may be\
   able to validate the server's certificate by relying on a trusted\
   certification authority whose certificate appears as one of the\
   intermediate certificates in the chain.)\

\
\
3.  Client Authentication\
\
   This document defines three new client authentication mechanisms,\
   each named after the type of client certificate involved: ECDSA_sign,\
   ECDSA_fixed_ECDH, and RSA_fixed_ECDH.  The ECDSA_sign mechanism is\
   usable with any of the non-anonymous ECC key exchange algorithms\
   described in Section 2 as well as other non-anonymous (non-ECC) key\
   exchange algorithms defined in TLS [2][3].  The ECDSA_fixed_ECDH and\
   RSA_fixed_ECDH mechanisms are usable with ECDH_ECDSA and ECDH_RSA.\
   Their use with ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA is prohibited because the\
   use of a long-term ECDH client key would jeopardize the forward\
   secrecy property of these algorithms.\
\
   The server can request ECC-based client authentication by including\
   one or more of these certificate types in its CertificateRequest\
   message.  The server must not include any certificate types that are\
   prohibited for the negotiated key exchange algorithm.  The client\
   must check if it possesses a certificate appropriate for any of the\
   methods suggested by the server and is willing to use it for\
   authentication.\
\
   If these conditions are not met, the client should send a client\
   Certificate message containing no certificates.  In this case, the\
   ClientKeyExchange should be sent as described in Section 2, and the\
   CertificateVerify should not be sent.  If the server requires client\
   authentication, it may respond with a fatal handshake failure alert.\
\
   If the client has an appropriate certificate and is willing to use it\
   for authentication, it must send that certificate in the client's\
   Certificate message (as per Section 5.6) and prove possession of the\
   private key corresponding to the certified key.  The process of\
   determining an appropriate certificate and proving possession is\
   different for each authentication mechanism and described below.\
\
   NOTE: It is permissible for a server to request (and the client to\
   send) a client certificate of a different type than the server\
   certificate.\
\
3.1.  ECDSA_sign\
\
   To use this authentication mechanism, the client MUST possess a\
   certificate containing an ECDSA-capable public key and signed with\
   ECDSA.\
\
   The client proves possession of the private key corresponding to the\
   certified key by including a signature in the CertificateVerify\
   message as described in Section 5.8.\

RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
3.2.  ECDSA_fixed_ECDH\
\
   To use this authentication mechanism, the client MUST possess a\
   certificate containing an ECDH-capable public key, and that\
   certificate MUST be signed with ECDSA.  Furthermore, the client's\
   ECDH key MUST be on the same elliptic curve as the server's long-term\
   (certified) ECDH key.  This might limit use of this mechanism to\
   closed environments.  In situations where the client has an ECC key\
   on a different curve, it would have to authenticate using either\
   ECDSA_sign or a non-ECC mechanism (e.g., RSA).  Using fixed ECDH for\
   both servers and clients is computationally more efficient than\
   mechanisms providing forward secrecy.\
\
   When using this authentication mechanism, the client MUST send an\
   empty ClientKeyExchange as described in Section 5.7 and MUST NOT send\
   the CertificateVerify message.  The ClientKeyExchange is empty since\
   the client's ECDH public key required by the server to compute the\
   premaster secret is available inside the client's certificate.  The\
   client's ability to arrive at the same premaster secret as the server\
   (demonstrated by a successful exchange of Finished messages) proves\
   possession of the private key corresponding to the certified public\
   key, and the CertificateVerify message is unnecessary.\
\
3.3.  RSA_fixed_ECDH\
\
   This authentication mechanism is identical to ECDSA_fixed_ECDH except\
   that the client's certificate MUST be signed with RSA.\
\
   Note that while the ECDSA_sign, ECDSA_fixed_ECDH, and RSA_fixed_ECDH\
   client authentication mechanisms require the client's certificate to\
   be signed with a particular signature scheme, this specification does\
   not impose restrictions on signature schemes used elsewhere in the\
   certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and it\
   is expected that this will be taken into account in certification\
   authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are not\
   strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities\
   of a server to completely validate a given chain, the server may be\
   able to validate the clients certificate by relying on a trust anchor\
   that appears as one of the intermediate certificates in the chain.)\
\
4.  TLS Extensions for ECC\
\
   Two new TLS extensions are defined in this specification: (i) the\
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, and (ii) the Supported Point\
   Formats Extension.  These allow negotiating the use of specific\
   curves and point formats (e.g., compressed vs. uncompressed,\
   respectively) during a handshake starting a new session.  These\
   extensions are especially relevant for constrained clients that may\

\
RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
   only support a limited number of curves or point formats.  They\
   follow the general approach outlined in [4]; message details are\
   specified in Section 5.  The client enumerates the curves it supports\
   and the point formats it can parse by including the appropriate\
   extensions in its ClientHello message.  The server similarly\
   enumerates the point formats it can parse by including an extension\
   in its ServerHello message.\
\
   A TLS client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello\
   message SHOULD include these extensions.  Servers implementing ECC\
   cipher suites MUST support these extensions, and when a client uses\
   these extensions, servers MUST NOT negotiate the use of an ECC cipher\
   suite unless they can complete the handshake while respecting the\
   choice of curves and compression techniques specified by the client.\
   This eliminates the possibility that a negotiated ECC handshake will\
   be subsequently aborted due to a client's inability to deal with the\
   server's EC key.\
\
   The client MUST NOT include these extensions in the ClientHello\
   message if it does not propose any ECC cipher suites.  A client that\
   proposes ECC cipher suites may choose not to include these\
   extensions.  In this case, the server is free to choose any one of\
   the elliptic curves or point formats listed in Section 5.  That\
   section also describes the structure and processing of these\
   extensions in greater detail.\
\
   In the case of session resumption, the server simply ignores the\
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats\
   Extension appearing in the current ClientHello message.  These\
   extensions only play a role during handshakes negotiating a new\
   session.\
\
5.  Data Structures and Computations\
\
   This section specifies the data structures and computations used by\
   ECC-based key mechanisms specified in Sections 2, 3, and 4.  The\
   presentation language used here is the same as that used in TLS\
   [2][3].  Since this specification extends TLS, these descriptions\
   should be merged with those in the TLS specification and any others\
   that extend TLS.  This means that enum types may not specify all\
   possible values, and structures with multiple formats chosen with a\
   select() clause may not indicate all possible cases.\
\
5.1.  Client Hello Extensions\
\
   This section specifies two TLS extensions that can be included with\
   the ClientHello message as described in [4], the Supported Elliptic\
   Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats Extension.\

\
\
   When these extensions are sent:\
\
   The extensions SHOULD be sent along with any ClientHello message that\
   proposes ECC cipher suites.\
\
   Meaning of these extensions:\
\
   These extensions allow a client to enumerate the elliptic curves it\
   supports and/or the point formats it can parse.\
\
   Structure of these extensions:\
\
   The general structure of TLS extensions is described in [4], and this\
   specification adds two new types to ExtensionType.\
\
       enum { elliptic_curves(10), ec_point_formats(11) } ExtensionType;\
\
   elliptic_curves (Supported Elliptic Curves Extension):   Indicates\
      the set of elliptic curves supported by the client.  For this\
      extension, the opaque extension_data field contains\
      EllipticCurveList.  See Section 5.1.1 for details.\
\
   ec_point_formats (Supported Point Formats Extension):   Indicates the\
      set of point formats that the client can parse.  For this\
      extension, the opaque extension_data field contains\
      ECPointFormatList.  See Section 5.1.2 for details.\
\
   Actions of the sender:\
\
   A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message\
   appends these extensions (along with any others), enumerating the\
   curves it supports and the point formats it can parse.  Clients\
   SHOULD send both the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the\
   Supported Point Formats Extension.  If the Supported Point Formats\
   Extension is indeed sent, it MUST contain the value 0 (uncompressed)\
   as one of the items in the list of point formats.\
\
   Actions of the receiver:\
\
   A server that receives a ClientHello containing one or both of these\
   extensions MUST use the client's enumerated capabilities to guide its\
   selection of an appropriate cipher suite.  One of the proposed ECC\
   cipher suites must be negotiated only if the server can successfully\
   complete the handshake while using the curves and point formats\
   supported by the client (cf. Sections 5.3 and 5.4).\

   NOTE: A server participating in an ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange may use\
   different curves for (i) the ECDSA key in its certificate, and (ii)\
   the ephemeral ECDH key in the ServerKeyExchange message.  The server\
   must consider the extensions in both cases.\
\
   If a server does not understand the Supported Elliptic Curves\
   Extension, does not understand the Supported Point Formats Extension,\
   or is unable to complete the ECC handshake while restricting itself\
   to the enumerated curves and point formats, it MUST NOT negotiate the\
   use of an ECC cipher suite.  Depending on what other cipher suites\
   are proposed by the client and supported by the server, this may\
   result in a fatal handshake failure alert due to the lack of common\
   cipher suites.\

      Values 0xFE00 through 0xFEFF are reserved for private use.  Values\
      0xFF01 and 0xFF02 indicate that the client supports arbitrary\

   of the following octets.  Note that the first two octets indicate the\

\
   A client that supports arbitrary explicit characteristic-2 curves\

            ECPointFormat ec_point_format_list<1..2^8-1>\
        } ECPointFormatList;\
\
   Three point formats are included in the definition of ECPointFormat\
   above.  The uncompressed point format is the default format in that\
   implementations of this document MUST support it for all of their\
   supported curves.  Compressed point formats reduce bandwidth by\
   including only the x-coordinate and a single bit of the y-coordinate\
   of the point.  Implementations of this document MAY support the\
   ansiX962_compressed_prime and ansiX962_compressed_char2 formats,\
   where the former applies only to prime curves and the latter applies\
   only to characteristic-2 curves.  (These formats are specified in\
   [7].)  Values 248 through 255 are reserved for private use.\

\
5.2.  Server Hello Extension\
\
   This section specifies a TLS extension that can be included with the\
   ServerHello message as described in [4], the Supported Point Formats\
   Extension.\
\
   When this extension is sent:\
\
   The Supported Point Formats Extension is included in a ServerHello\
   message in response to a ClientHello message containing the Supported\
   Point Formats Extension when negotiating an ECC cipher suite.\
\
   Meaning of this extension:\
\
   This extension allows a server to enumerate the point formats it can\
   parse (for the curve that will appear in its ServerKeyExchange\
   message when using the ECDHE_ECDSA, ECDHE_RSA, or ECDH_anon key\
   exchange algorithm, or for the curve that is used in the server's\
   public key that will appear in its Certificate message when using the\
   ECDH_ECDSA or ECDH_RSA key exchange algorithm).\
\
   Structure of this extension:\
\
   The server's Supported Point Formats Extension has the same structure\
   as the client's Supported Point Formats Extension (see\
   Section 5.1.2).  Items in elliptic_curve_list here are ordered\
   according to the server's preference (favorite choice first).  Note\
   that the server may include items that were not found in the client's\
   list (e.g., the server may prefer to receive points in compressed\
   format even when a client cannot parse this format: the same client\
   may nevertheless be capable of outputting points in compressed\
   format).\

\
\
   Actions of the sender:\
\
   A server that selects an ECC cipher suite in response to a\
   ClientHello message including a Supported Point Formats Extension\
   appends this extension (along with others) to its ServerHello\
   message, enumerating the point formats it can parse.  The Supported\
   Point Formats Extension, when used, MUST contain the value 0\
   (uncompressed) as one of the items in the list of point formats.\
\
   Actions of the receiver:\
\
   A client that receives a ServerHello message containing a Supported\
   Point Formats Extension MUST respect the server's choice of point\
   formats during the handshake (cf. Sections 5.6 and 5.7).  If no\
   Supported Point Formats Extension is received with the ServerHello,\
   this is equivalent to an extension allowing only the uncompressed\
   point format.\
\
5.3.  Server Certificate\
\
   When this message is sent:\
\
   This message is sent in all non-anonymous ECC-based key exchange\
   algorithms.\
\
   Meaning of this message:\
\
   This message is used to authentically convey the server's static\
   public key to the client.  The following table shows the server\
   certificate type appropriate for each key exchange algorithm.  ECC\
   public keys MUST be encoded in certificates as described in\
   Section 5.9.\
\
   NOTE: The server's Certificate message is capable of carrying a chain\
   of certificates.  The restrictions mentioned in Table 3 apply only to\
   the server's certificate (first in the chain).\

   Structure of this message:\
\
   Identical to the TLS Certificate format.\
\
   Actions of the sender:\
\
   The server constructs an appropriate certificate chain and conveys it\
   to the client in the Certificate message.  If the client has used a\
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, the public key in the server's\
   certificate MUST respect the client's choice of elliptic curves; in\
   particular, the public key MUST employ a named curve (not the same\
   curve as an explicit curve) unless the client has indicated support\
   for explicit curves of the appropriate type.  If the client has used\
   a Supported Point Formats Extension, both the server's public key\
   point and (in the case of an explicit curve) the curve's base point\
   MUST respect the client's choice of point formats.  (A server that\
   cannot satisfy these requirements MUST NOT choose an ECC cipher suite\
   in its ServerHello message.)\

\
\
   Actions of the receiver:\
\
   The client validates the certificate chain, extracts the server's\
   public key, and checks that the key type is appropriate for the\
   negotiated key exchange algorithm.  (A possible reason for a fatal\
   handshake failure is that the client's capabilities for handling\
   elliptic curves and point formats are exceeded; cf. Section 5.1.)\

5.6.  Client Certificate\
\
   When this message is sent:\
\
   This message is sent in response to a CertificateRequest when a\
   client has a suitable certificate and has decided to proceed with\
   client authentication.  (Note that if the server has used a Supported\
   Point Formats Extension, a certificate can only be considered\
   suitable for use with the ECDSA_sign, RSA_fixed_ECDH, and\
   ECDSA_fixed_ECDH authentication methods if the public key point\
   specified in it respects the server's choice of point formats.  If no\
   Supported Point Formats Extension has been used, a certificate can\
   only be considered suitable for use with these authentication methods\
   if the point is represented in uncompressed point format.)\

      in uncompressed or compressed format.  Here, the format MUST\
      conform to what the server has requested through a Supported Point\

   When this message is sent:\
\
   This message is sent when the client sends a client certificate\
   containing a public key usable for digital signatures, e.g., when the\
   client is authenticated using the ECDSA_sign mechanism.\
\
   Meaning of the message:\
\
   This message contains a signature that proves possession of the\
   private key corresponding to the public key in the client's\
   Certificate message.\
\
   Structure of this message:\
\
   The TLS CertificateVerify message and the underlying Signature type\
   are defined in [2] and [3], and the latter is extended here in\
   Section 5.4.  For the ecdsa case, the signature field in the\
   CertificateVerify message contains an ECDSA signature computed over\
   handshake messages exchanged so far, exactly similar to\
   CertificateVerify with other signing algorithms in [2] and [3]:\
\
        CertificateVerify.signature.sha_hash\
            SHA(handshake_messages);\
\
   ECDSA signatures are computed as described in Section 5.10, and SHA\

   algorithm other than SHA-1.  As per ANSI X9.62, an ECDSA signature\

\
   The client computes its signature over all handshake messages sent or\
   received starting at client hello and up to but not including this\
   message.  It uses the private key corresponding to its certified\
   public key to compute the signature, which is conveyed in the format\

   in the client's Certificate message.\
\
5.9.  Elliptic Curve Certificates\
\
   X.509 certificates containing ECC public keys or signed using ECDSA\
   MUST comply with [14] or another RFC that replaces or extends it.\

   in ANSI X9.62 [7], FIPS 186-2 [11], and SEC 2 [13].\
\
5.10.  ECDH, ECDSA, and RSA Computations\
\
   All ECDH calculations (including parameter and key generation as well\
   as the shared secret calculation) are performed according to [6]\
   using the ECKAS-DH1 scheme with the identity map as key derivation\
   function (KDF), so that the premaster secret is the x-coordinate of\
   the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet\
   string.  Note that this octet string (Z in IEEE 1363 terminology) as\
   output by FE2OSP, the Field Element to Octet String Conversion\
   Primitive, has constant length for any given field; leading zeros\
   found in this octet string MUST NOT be truncated.\
\
   (Note that this use of the identity KDF is a technicality.  The\
   complete picture is that ECDH is employed with a non-trivial KDF\
   because TLS does not directly use the premaster secret for anything\
   other than for computing the master secret.  As of TLS 1.0 [2] and\
   1.1 [3], this means that the MD5- and SHA-1-based TLS PRF serves as a\
   KDF; it is conceivable that future TLS versions or new TLS extensions\
   introduced in the future may vary this computation.)\
\
   All ECDSA computations MUST be performed according to ANSI X9.62 [7]\
   or its successors.  Data to be signed/verified is hashed, and the\
   result run directly through the ECDSA algorithm with no additional\
   hashing.  The default hash function is SHA-1 [10], and sha_size (see\
   Sections 5.4 and 5.8) is 20.  However, an alternative hash function,\
   such as one of the new SHA hash functions specified in FIPS 180-2\
   [10], may be used instead if the certificate containing the EC public\

   key explicitly requires use of another hash function.  (The mechanism\
   for specifying the required hash function has not been standardized,\
   but this provision anticipates such standardization and obviates the\
   need to update this document in response.  Future PKIX RFCs may\
   choose, for example, to specify the hash function to be used with a\
   public key in the parameters field of subjectPublicKeyInfo.)\

   All RSA signatures must be generated and verified according to PKCS#1\
   [12] block type 1.\

RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
   The key exchange method, cipher, and hash algorithm for each of these\
   cipher suites are easily determined by examining the name.  Ciphers\
   (other than AES ciphers) and hash algorithms are defined in [2] and\
   [3].  AES ciphers are defined in [19].\
\
   Server implementations SHOULD support all of the following cipher\
   suites, and client implementations SHOULD support at least one of\
   them: TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,\
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,\
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, and\
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   Security issues are discussed throughout this memo.\
\
   For TLS handshakes using ECC cipher suites, the security\
   considerations in appendices D.2 and D.3 of [2] and [3] apply\
   accordingly.\
\
   Security discussions specific to ECC can be found in [6] and [7].\
   One important issue that implementers and users must consider is\
   elliptic curve selection.  Guidance on selecting an appropriate\
   elliptic curve size is given in Table 1.\
\
   Beyond elliptic curve size, the main issue is elliptic curve\
   structure.  As a general principle, it is more conservative to use\
   elliptic curves with as little algebraic structure as possible.\
   Thus, random curves are more conservative than special curves such as\
   Koblitz curves, and curves over F_p with p random are more\
   conservative than curves over F_p with p of a special form (and\
   curves over F_p with p random might be considered more conservative\
   than curves over F_2^m as there is no choice between multiple fields\
   of similar size for characteristic 2).  Note, however, that algebraic\
   structure can also lead to implementation efficiencies, and\
   implementers and users may, therefore, need to balance conservatism\
   against a need for efficiency.  Concrete attacks are known against\
   only very few special classes of curves, such as supersingular\
   curves, and these classes are excluded from the ECC standards that\
   this document references [6], [7].\
\
   Another issue is the potential for catastrophic failures when a\
   single elliptic curve is widely used.  In this case, an attack on the\
   elliptic curve might result in the compromise of a large number of\
   keys.  Again, this concern may need to be balanced against efficiency\
   and interoperability improvements associated with widely-used curves.\
   Substantial additional information on elliptic curve choice can be\
   found in [5], [6], [7], and [11].\

RFC 4492               ECC Cipher Suites for TLS                May 2006\
\
\
   Implementers and users must also consider whether they need forward\
   secrecy.  Forward secrecy refers to the property that session keys\
   are not compromised if the static, certified keys belonging to the\
   server and client are compromised.  The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key\
   exchange algorithms provide forward secrecy protection in the event\
   of server key compromise, while ECDH_ECDSA and ECDH_RSA do not.\
   Similarly, if the client is providing a static, certified key,\
   ECDSA_sign client authentication provides forward secrecy protection\
   in the event of client key compromise, while ECDSA_fixed_ECDH and\
   RSA_fixed_ECDH do not.  Thus, to obtain complete forward secrecy\
   protection, ECDHE_ECDSA or ECDHE_RSA must be used for key exchange,\
   with ECDSA_sign used for client authentication if necessary.  Here\
   again the security benefits of forward secrecy may need to be\
   balanced against the improved efficiency offered by other options.\
\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document describes three new name spaces for use with the TLS\
   protocol:\
\
   o  NamedCurve (Section 5.1)\
\
   o  ECPointFormat (Section 5.1)\
\
   o  ECCurveType (Section 5.4)\
\
   For each name space, this document defines the initial value\
   assignments and defines a range of 256 values (NamedCurve) or eight\
   values (ECPointFormat and ECCurveType) reserved for Private Use.  Any\
   additional assignments require IETF Consensus action [16].\

RFC 4490                  Using GOST with CMS                   May 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] is used for digital signature,\
   digest, authentication, and encryption of arbitrary message contents.\
   This companion specification describes the use of cryptographic\
   algorithms GOST 28147-89 [GOST28147], GOST R 34.10-94 [GOST3431095,\
   GOSTR341094], GOST R 34.10-2001 [GOST3431004, GOSTR341001], and GOST\
   R 34.11-94 [GOST3431195, GOSTR341194] in CMS, as proposed by the\
   CRYPTO-PRO Company for the "Russian Cryptographic Software\
   Compatibility Agreement" community.  This document does not describe\
   these cryptographic algorithms; they are defined in corresponding\
   national standards.\
\
   The CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.208-88], using BER\
   encoding [X.209-88].  This document specifies the algorithm\
   identifiers for each algorithm, including ASN.1 for object\
   identifiers and any associated parameters.\
\
   The fields in the CMS employed by each algorithm are identified.\
\
1.1.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Message Digest Algorithms\
\
   This section specifies the conventions for using the digest algorithm\
   GOST R 34.11-94 employed by CMS.\
\
   Digest values are located in the DigestedData digest field and the\
   Message Digest authenticated attribute.  In addition, digest values\
   are input to signature algorithms.\
\
2.1.  Message Digest Algorithm GOST R 34.11-94\
\
   The hash function GOST R 34.11-94 has been developed by "GUBS of\
   Federal Agency Government Communication and Information" and "All-\
   Russian Scientific and Research Institute of Standardization".  The\
   algorithm GOST R 34.11-94 produces a 256-bit hash value of the\
   arbitrary finite bit-length input.  This document does not contain\
   the full GOST R 34.11-94 specification, which can be found in\
   [GOSTR341194] in Russian.  [Schneier95], ch. 18.11, p. 454, contains\
   a brief technical description in English.\

RFC 4490                  Using GOST with CMS                   May 2006\
\
\
   The hash algorithm GOST R 34.11-94 has the following identifier:\
\
   id-GostR3411-94 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
         { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           gostr3411(9) }\
\
   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST be present, and the\
   parameters field MUST contain NULL.  Implementations MAY accept the\
   GOST R 34.11-94 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters as well\
   as NULL parameters.\
\
   This function is always used with default parameters id-GostR3411-\
   94-CryptoProParamSet (see Section 8.2 of [CPALGS]).\
\
   When the Message Digest authenticated attribute is present, the\
   DigestedData digest contains a 32-byte digest in little-endian\
   representation:\
\
   GostR3411-94-Digest ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (32))\
\
3.  Signature Algorithms\
\
   This section specifies the CMS procedures for the GOST R 34.10-94 and\
   GOST R 34.10-2001 signature algorithms.\
\
   Signature algorithm identifiers are located in the SignerInfo\
   signatureAlgorithm field of SignedData.  Also, signature algorithm\
   identifiers are located in the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field of\
   countersignature attributes.\
\
   Signature values are located in the SignerInfo signature field of\
   SignedData.  Also, signature values are located in the SignerInfo\
   signature field of countersignature attributes.\
\
3.1.  Signature Algorithm GOST R 34.10-94\
\
   GOST R 34.10-94 has been developed by "GUBS of Federal Agency\
   Government Communication and Information" and "All-Russian Scientific\
   and Research Institute of Standardization".  This signature algorithm\
   MUST be used conjointly with the GOST R 34.11-94 message digest\
   algorithm.  This document does not contain the full GOST R 34.10-94\
   specification, which is fully described in [GOSTR341094] in Russian;\
   and a brief description in English can be found in [Schneier95], ch.\
   20.3, p. 495.\
\
   The GOST R 34.10-94 signature algorithm has the following public key\
   algorithm identifier:\

\
   id-GostR3410-94-signature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= id-GostR3410-94\
\
   id-GostR3410-94 is defined in Section 2.3.1 of [CPPK].\
\
   The signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-94 generates a digital signature\
   in the form of two 256-bit numbers, r' and s.  Its octet string\
   representation consists of 64 octets, where the first 32 octets\
   contain the big-endian representation of s and the second 32 octets\
   contain the big-endian representation of r'.\
\
   GostR3410-94-Signature ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (64))\
\
3.2.  Signature Algorithm GOST R 34.10-2001\
\
   GOST R 34.10-2001 has been developed by "GUBS of Federal Agency\
   Government Communication and Information" and "All-Russian Scientific\
   and Research Institute of Standardization".  This signature algorithm\
   MUST be used conjointly with GOST R 34.11-94.  This document does not\
   contain the full GOST R 34.10-2001 specification, which is fully\
   described in [GOSTR341001].\
\
   The signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-2001 has the following public\
   key algorithm identifier:\
\
   id-GostR3410-2001-signature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= id-GostR3410-2001\
\
   id-GostR3410-2001 is defined in Section 2.3.2 of [CPPK].\
\
   The signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-2001 generates a digital\
   signature in the form of two 256-bit numbers, r and s.  Its octet\
   string representation consists of 64 octets, where the first 32\
   octets contain the big-endian representation of s and the second 32\
   octets contain the big-endian representation of r.\
\
   GostR3410-2001-Signature ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (64))\
\
4.  Key Management Algorithms\
\
   This chapter describes the key agreement and key transport\
   algorithms, based on the VKO GOST R 34.10-94 and VKO GOST R 34.10-\
   2001 key derivation algorithms, and the CryptoPro and GOST 28147-89\
   key wrap algorithms, described in [CPALGS].  They MUST be used only\
   with the content encryption algorithm GOST 28147-89, defined in\
   Section 5 of this document.\

\
\
4.1.  Key Agreement Algorithms\
\
   This section specifies the conventions employed by CMS\
   implementations that support key agreement using both the VKO GOST R\
   34.10-94 and VKO GOST R 34.10-2001 algorithms, described in [CPALGS].\
\
   Key agreement algorithm identifiers are located in the EnvelopedData\
   RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm and\
   AuthenticatedData RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo\
   keyEncryptionAlgorithm fields.\
\
   Wrapped content-encryption keys are located in the EnvelopedData\
   RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo RecipientEncryptedKeys\
   encryptedKey field.  Wrapped message-authentication keys are located\
   in the AuthenticatedData RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo\
   RecipientEncryptedKeys encryptedKey field.\
\
4.1.1.  Key Agreement Algorithms Based on GOST R 34.10-94/2001 Public\
        Keys\
\
   The EnvelopedData RecipientInfos KeyAgreeRecipientInfo field is used\
   as follows:\
\
      The version MUST be 3.\
\
      The originator MUST be the originatorKey alternative.  The\
      originatorKey algorithm field MUST contain the object identifier\
      id-GostR3410-94 or id-GostR3410-2001 and corresponding parameters\
      (defined in Sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2 of [CPPK]).\
\
      The originatorKey publicKey field MUST contain the sender's public\
      key.\
\
      keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST be the id-GostR3410-94-CryptoPro-ESDH\
      or the id-GostR3410-2001-CryptoPro-ESDH algorithm identifier,\
      depending on the recipient public key algorithm.  The algorithm\
      identifier parameter field for these algorithms is\
      KeyWrapAlgorithm, and this parameter MUST be present.  The\
      KeyWrapAlgorithm denotes the algorithm and parameters used to\
      encrypt the content-encryption key with the pairwise key-\
      encryption key generated using the VKO GOST R 34.10-94 or the VKO\
      GOST R 34.10-2001 key agreement algorithms.\
\
      The algorithm identifiers and parameter syntax is:\
\
        id-GostR3410-94-CryptoPro-ESDH OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
            { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\

              keyWrap(13) cryptoPro(1) }\
\
      The CryptoPro Key Wrap algorithm is described in Sections 6.3 and\
      6.4 of [CPALGS].\
\
      When keyEncryptionAlgorithm is id-GostR3410-2001-CryptoPro-ESDH,\
      KeyWrapAlgorithm algorithm MUST be either the id-Gost28147-89-\
      CryptoPro-KeyWrap or id-Gost28147-89-None-KeyWrap algorithm\
      identifier.\
\
        id-Gost28147-89-None-KeyWrap OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
            { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
              keyWrap(13) none(0) }\
\
      The GOST 28147-89 Key Wrap algorithm is described in Sections 6.1\
      and 6.2 of [CPALGS].\
\
      KeyWrapAlgorithm algorithm parameters MUST be present.  The syntax\
      for KeyWrapAlgorithm algorithm parameters is\
\
        Gost28147-89-KeyWrapParameters ::=\
          SEQUENCE {\
              encryptionParamSet Gost28147-89-ParamSet,\

          }\
          Gost28147-89-ParamSet ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
\
      Gost28147-89-KeyWrapParameters ukm MUST be absent.\
\
      KeyAgreeRecipientInfo ukm MUST be present and contain eight\
      octets.\

\
   Then the key wrap algorithm, specified by KeyWrapAlgorithm, is\
   applied to produce CEK_ENC, CEK_MAC, and UKM.  Gost28147-89-\

   (described in [CPALGS]) is applied to produce the KEK.\
\

\
   Content encryption algorithms are used to encipher the content\
   located in the EnvelopedData EncryptedContentInfo encryptedContent\
   field and the EncryptedData EncryptedContentInfo encryptedContent\
   field.\
\
5.1.  Content Encryption Algorithm GOST 28147-89\
\
   This section specifies the use of GOST 28147-89 algorithm for data\
   encipherment.\
\
   GOST 28147-89 is fully described in [GOST28147] (in Russian).\
\
   This document specifies the following object identifier (OID) for\
   this algorithm:\
\
   id-Gost28147-89 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
         { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           gost28147-89(21) }\
\
   Algorithm parameters MUST be present and have the following\
   structure:\
\
     Gost28147-89-Parameters ::=\
       SEQUENCE {\
         iv                   Gost28147-89-IV,\
         encryptionParamSet   OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
        }\
\
     Gost28147-89-IV ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (8))\
\
   encryptionParamSet specifies the set of corresponding Gost28147-89-\
   ParamSetParameters (see Section 8.1 of [CPALGS])\
\
6.  MAC Algorithms\
\
   This section specifies the conventions employed by CMS\
   implementations that support the message authentication code (MAC)\
   based on GOST R 34.11-94.\
\
   MAC algorithm identifiers are located in the AuthenticatedData\
   macAlgorithm field.\
\
   MAC values are located in the AuthenticatedData mac field.\
\
6.1.  HMAC with GOST R 34.11-94\
\
   HMAC_GOSTR3411 (K,text) function is based on hash function GOST R\
   34.11-94, as defined in Section 3 of [CPALGS].\

RFC 4490                  Using GOST with CMS                   May 2006\
\
\
   This document specifies the following OID for this algorithm:\
\
   id-HMACGostR3411-94 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
         { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           hmacgostr3411(10) }\
\
   This algorithm has the same parameters as the GOST R 34.11-94 digest\
   algorithm and uses the same OIDs for their identification (see\
   [CPPK]).\
\
7.  Use with S/MIME\
\
   This section defines the use of the algorithms defined in this\
   document with S/MIME [RFC3851].\
\
7.1.  Parameter micalg\
\
   When using the algorithms defined in this document, micalg parameter\
   SHOULD be set to "gostr3411-94"; otherwise, it MUST be set to\
   "unknown".\
\
7.2.  Attribute SMIMECapabilities\
\
   The SMIMECapability value that indicates support for the GOST R\
   34.11-94 digest algorithm is the SEQUENCE with the capabilityID field\
   containing the object identifier id-GostR3411-94 and no parameters.\
   The DER encoding is:\
\
     30 08 06 06  2A 85 03 02  02 09\
\
   The SMIMECapability value that indicates support for the GOST\
   28147-89 encryption algorithm is the SEQUENCE with the capabilityID\
   field containing the object identifier id-Gost28147-89 and no\
   parameters.  The DER encoding is:\
\
     30 08 06 06  2A 85 03 02  02 15\
\
   If the sender wishes to indicate support for a specific parameter\
   set, SMIMECapability parameters MUST contain the Gost28147-89-\
   Parameters structure.  Recipients MUST ignore the Gost28147-89-\
   Parameters iv field and assume that the sender supports the\
   parameters specified in the Gost28147-89-Parameters\
   encryptionParamSet field.\
\
   The DER encoding for the SMIMECapability, indicating support for GOST\
   28147-89 with id-Gost28147-89-CryptoPro-A-ParamSet (see [CPALGS]),\
   is:\

\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   Conforming applications MUST use unique values for ukm and iv.\
   Recipients MAY verify that ukm and iv, specified by the sender, are\
   unique.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that software applications verify that signature\
   values, subject public keys, and algorithm parameters conform to\
   [GOSTR341001] and [GOSTR341094] standards prior to their use.\
\
   Cryptographic algorithm parameters affect algorithm strength.  The\
   use of parameters not listed in [CPALGS] is NOT RECOMMENDED (see the\
   Security Considerations section of [CPALGS]).\
\
   Use of the same key for signature and key derivation is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED.  When signed CMS documents are used as an analogue to a\
   manual signing, in the context of Russian Federal Electronic Digital\
   Signature Law [RFEDSL], signer certificate MUST contain the keyUsage\
   extension, it MUST be critical, and keyUsage MUST NOT include\
   keyEncipherment or keyAgreement (see [PROFILE], Section 4.2.1.3).\
   Application SHOULD be submitted for examination by an authorized\
   agency in appropriate levels of target_of_evaluation (TOE), according\
   to [RFEDSL], [RFLLIC], and [CRYPTOLIC].\
\
9.  Examples\
\
   Examples here are stored in the same format as the examples in\
   [RFC4134] and can be extracted using the same program.\
\
   If you want to extract without the program, copy all the lines\
   between the "|>" and "|<" markers, remove any page breaks, and remove\
   the "|" in the first column of each line.  The result is a valid\
   Base64 blob that can be processed by any Base64 decoder.\
\
9.1.  Signed Message\
\
   This message is signed using the sample certificate from Section 4.2\
   of [CPPK].  The public key (x,y) from the same section can be used to\
   verify the message signature.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document proposes an extension to the Resource Reservation\
   Protocol (RSVP) [1] to allow an existing reservation to be reduced in\
   allocated bandwidth in lieu of tearing that reservation down when\
   some of that reservation's bandwidth is needed for other purposes.\
   Several examples exist in which this mechanism may be utilized.\
\
   The bandwidth allotted to an individual reservation may be reduced\
   due to a variety of reasons such as preemption, etc.  In such cases,\
   when the entire bandwidth allocated to a reservation is not required,\
   the reservation need not be torn down.  The solution described in\
   this document allows endpoints to negotiate a new (lower) bandwidth\
   that falls at or below the specified new bandwidth maximum allocated\
   by the network.  Using a voice session as an example, this indication\
   in RSVP could lead endpoints, using another protocol such as Session\
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [9], to signal for a lower-bandwidth codec\
   and retain the reservation.\
\
   With RSVP aggregation [2], two aggregate flows with differing\
   priority levels may traverse the same router interface.  If that\
   router interface reaches bandwidth capacity and is then asked to\
   establish a new reservation or increase an existing reservation, the\
\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   router has to make a choice: deny the new request (because all\
   resources have been utilized) or preempt an existing lower-priority\
   reservation to make room for the new or expanded reservation.\
\
   If the flow being preempted is an aggregate of many individual flows,\
   this has greater consequences.  While [2] clearly does not terminate\
   all the individual flows if an aggregate is torn down, this event\
   will cause packets to be discarded during aggregate reservation\
   reestablishment.  This document describes a method where only the\
   minimum required bandwidth is taken away from the lower-priority\
   aggregated reservation and the entire reservation is not preempted.\
   This has the advantage that only some of the microflows making up the\
   aggregate are affected.  Without this extension, all individual flows\
   are affected and the deaggregator will have to attempt the\
   reservation request with a reduced bandwidth.\
\
   RSVP tunnels utilizing IPsec [8] also require an indication that the\
   reservation must be reduced to a certain amount (or less).  RSVP\
   aggregation with IPsec tunnels is being defined in [11], which should\
   be able to take advantage of the mechanism created here in this\
   specification.\
\
   Note that when this document refers to a router interface being\
   "full" or "at capacity", this does not imply that all of the\
   bandwidth has been used, but rather that all of the bandwidth\
   available for reservation(s) via RSVP under the applicable policy has\
   been used.  Policies for real-time traffic routinely reserve capacity\
   for routing and inelastic applications, and may distinguish between\
   voice, video, and other real-time applications.\
\
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [10] is an indication that the\
   transmitting endpoint must reduce its transmission.  It does not\
   provide sufficient indication to tell the endpoint by how much the\
   reduction should be.  Hence the application may have to attempt\
   multiple times before it is able to drop its bandwidth utilization\
   below the available limit.  Therefore, while we consider ECN to be\
   very useful for elastic applications, it is not sufficient for the\
   purpose of inelastic application where an indication of bandwidth\
   availability is useful for codec selection.\
\
   Section 2 discusses the individual reservation flow problem, while\
   Section 3 discusses the aggregate reservation flow problem space.\
   Section 4 lists the requirements for this extension.  Section 5\
   details the protocol changes necessary in RSVP to create a\
   reservation reduction indication.  And finally, the appendix provides\
   a walk-through example of how this extension modifies RSVP\
   functionality in an aggregate scenario.\

\
2.  Individual Reservation Reduction Scenario\
\
   Figure 1 is a network topology that is used to describe the benefit\
   of bandwidth reduction in an individual reservation.\

                   Figure 1.  Simple Reservation Flows\
\
         Legend/Rules:\
\
         - Flow 1 priority = 300\
         - Flow 2 priority = 100\
         - Both flows are shown in the same direction (left to\
           right).  Corresponding flows in the reverse direction are\
           not shown for diagram simplicity\
\
   RSVP is a reservation establishment protocol in one direction only.\
   This split-path philosophy is because the routed path from one device\
   to the other in one direction might not be the routed path for\
   communicating between the same two endpoints in the reverse\
   direction.  End-systems must request 2 one-way reservations if that\
   is what is needed for a particular application (like voice calls).\
   Please refer to [1] for the details on how this functions.  This\
   example only describes the reservation scenario in one direction for\
   simplicity's sake.\
\
   Figure 1 depicts 2 routers (R1 and R2) initially with only one flow\
   (Flow 1).  The flows are forwarded from R1 to R2 via Int 2.  For this\
   example, let us say that Flow 1 and Flow 2 each require 80 units of\
   bandwidth (such as for the codec G.711 with no silence suppression).\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Let us also say that the RSVP bandwidth limit for Int 2 of R1 is 100\
   units.\
\
   As described in [3], a priority indication is established for each\
   flow.  In fact, there are two priority indications:\
\
      1) one to establish the reservation, and\
\
      2) one to defend the reservation.\
\
   In this example, Flow 1 and Flow 2 have an 'establishing' and a\
   'defending' priority of 300 and 100, respectively.  Flow 2 will have\
   a higher establishing priority than Flow 1 has for its defending\
   priority.  This means that when Flow 2 is signaled, and if no\
   bandwidth is available at the interface, Flow 1 will have to\
   relinquish bandwidth in favor of the higher-priority request of Flow\
   2.  The priorities assigned to a reservation are always end-to-end,\
   and not altered by any routers in transit.\
\
   Without the benefit of this specification, Flow 1 will be preempted.\
   This specification makes it possible for the ResvErr message to\
   indicate that 20 units are still available for a reservation to\
   remain up (the interface's 100 units maximum minus Flow 2's 80\
   units).  The reservation initiating node (router or end-system) for\
   Flow 1 has the opportunity to renegotiate (via call signaling) for\
   acceptable parameters within the existing and available bandwidth for\
   the flow (for example, it may decide to change to using a codec such\
   as G.729)\
\
   The problems avoided with the partial failure of the flow are:\
\
   - Reduced packet loss, which results as Flow 1 attempts to\
     reestablish the reservation for a lower bandwidth.\
\
   - Inefficiency caused by multiple attempts until Flow 1 is able to\
     request bandwidth equal to or lower than what is available.  If\
     Flow 1 is established with much less than what is available then it\
     leads to inefficient use of available bandwidth.\

3.  RSVP Aggregation Overview\
\
   The following network overview is to help visualize the concerns that\
   this specification addresses in RSVP aggregates.  Figure 2 consists\
   of 10 routers (the boxes) and 11 flows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, A, B, C, D,\
   and E).  Initially, there will be 5 flows per aggregate (Flow 9 will\
   be introduced to cause the problem we are addressing in this\
   document), with 2 aggregates (X and Y); Flows 1 through 5 in\
   aggregate X and Flows A through E in aggregate Y.  These 2 aggregates\
   will cross one router interface utilizing all available capacity (in\
   this example).\
\
   RSVP aggregation (per [2]) is no different from an individual\
   reservation with respect to being unidirectional.\

\
\
      The path for aggregate X is:\
\
         R1 => R2 => R10 => R11 => R3 => R4\
\
      where aggregate X starts in R1, and deaggregates in R4.\
\
      Flows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 communicate through aggregate A.\
\
      The path for aggregate Y is:\
\
         R5 ::> R6 ::> R10 ::> R11 ::> R7 ::> R8\
\
      where aggregate Y starts in R5, and deaggregates in R8.\
\
      Flows A, B, C, D, and E communicate through aggregate B.\
\
   Both aggregates share one leg or physical link: between R10 and R11,\
   thus they share one outbound interface: Int 8 of R10, where\
   contention of resources may exist.  That link has an RSVP capacity of\
   800 kbps.  RSVP signaling (messages) is outside the 800 kbps in this\
   example, as is any session signaling protocol like SIP.\
\
3.1.  RSVP Aggregation Reduction Scenario\
\
   Figure 2 shows an established aggregated reservation (aggregate X)\
   between the routers R1 and R4.  This aggregated reservation consists\
   of 5 microflows (Flows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).  For the sake of this\
   discussion, let us assume that each flow represents a voice call and\
   requires 80 kb (such as for the codec G.711 with no silence\
   suppression).  Aggregate X request is for 400 kbps (80 kbps * 5\
   flows).  The priority of the aggregate is derived from the individual\
   microflows that it is made up of.  In the simple case, all flows of a\
   single priority are bundled as a single aggregate (another priority\
   level would be in another aggregate, even if traversing the same path\
   through the network).  There may be other ways in which the priority\
   of the aggregate is derived, but for this discussion it is sufficient\
   to note that each aggregate contains a priority (both hold and\
   defending priority).  The means of deriving the priority is out of\
   scope for this discussion.\
\
   Aggregate Y, in Figure 2, consists of Flows A, B, C, D, and E and\
   requires 400 kbps (80 kbps * 5 flows), and starts at R5 and ends R8.\
   This means there are two aggregates occupying all 800 kbps of the\
   RSVP capacity.\
\
   When Flow 9 is added into aggregate X, this will occupy 80 kbps more\
   than Int 8 on R10 has available (880k offered load vs. 800k capacity)\
   [1] and [2] create a behavior in RSVP to deny the entire aggregate Y\

\
\
   and all its individual flows because aggregate X has a higher\
   priority.  This situation is where this document focuses its\
   requirements and calls for a solution.  There should be some means to\
   signal to all affected routers of aggregate Y that only 80 kbps is\
   needed to accommodate another (higher priority) aggregate.  A\
   solution that accomplishes this reduction instead of a failure could:\
\
      - reduce significant packet loss of all flows within aggregate Y\
\
   During the re-reservation request period of time no packets will\
   traverse the aggregate until it is reestablished.\
\
      - reduces the chances that the reestablishment of the aggregate\
        will reserve an inefficient amount of bandwidth, causing the\
        likely preemption of more individual flows at the aggregator\
        than would be necessary had the aggregator had more information\
        (that RSVP does not provide at this time)\
\
   During reestablishment of the aggregation in Figure 2 (without any\
   modification to RSVP), R8 would guess at how much bandwidth to ask\
   for in the new RESV message.  It could request too much bandwidth,\
   and have to wait for the error that not that much bandwidth was\
   available; it could request too little bandwidth and have that\
   aggregation accepted, but this would mean that more individual flows\
   would need to be preempted outside the aggregate than were necessary,\
   leading to inefficiencies in the opposite direction.\
\
4.  Requirements for Reservation Reduction\
\
   The following are the requirements to reduce the bandwidth of a\
   reservation.  This applies to both individual and aggregate\
   reservations:\
\
   Req#1 - MUST have the ability to differentiate one reservation from\
           another.  In the case of aggregates, it MUST distinguish one\
           aggregate from other flows.\
\
   Req#2 - MUST have the ability to indicate within an RSVP error\
           message (generated at the router with the congested\
           interface) that a specific reservation (individual or\
           aggregate) is to be reduced in bandwidth.\
\
   Req#3 - MUST have the ability to indicate within the same error\
           message the new maximum amount of bandwidth that is available\
           to be utilized within the existing reservation, but no more.\
\
\
\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Req#4 - MUST NOT produce a case in which retransmitted reduction\
           indications further reduce the bandwidth of a reservation.\
           Any additional reduction in bandwidth for a specified\
           reservation MUST be signaled in a new message.\
\
   RSVP messages are unreliable and can get lost.  This specification\
   should not compound any error in the network.  If a reduction message\
   were lost, another one needs to be sent.  If the receiver ends up\
   receiving two copies to reduce the bandwidth of a reservation by some\
   amount, it is likely the router will reduce the bandwidth by twice\
   the amount that was actually called for.  This will be in error.\
\
5.  RSVP Bandwidth Reduction Solution\
\
   When a reservation is partially failed, a ResvErr (Reservation Error)\
   message is generated just as it is done currently with preemptions.\
   The ERROR_SPEC object and the PREEMPTION_PRI object are included as\
   well.  Very few additions/changes are needed to the ResvErr message\
   to support partial preemptions.  A new error subcode is required and\
   is defined in Section 5.1.  The ERROR_SPEC object contained in the\
   ResvErr message indicates the flowspec that is reserved.  The\
   bandwidth indication in this flowspec SHOULD be less than the\
   original reservation request.  This is defined in Section 5.2.\
\
   A comment about RESV messages that do not use reliable transport:\
   This document RECOMMENDS that ResvErr messages be made reliable by\
   implementing mechanisms in [6].\
\
   The current behavior in RSVP requires a ResvTear message to be\
   transmitted upstream when the ResvErr message is transmitted\
   downstream (per [1]).  This ResvTear message terminates the\
   reservation in all routers upstream of the router where the failure\
   occurred.  This document requires that the ResvTear is only generated\
   when the reservation is to be completely removed.  In cases where the\
   reservation is only to be reduced, routers compliant with this\
   specification require that the ResvTear message MUST NOT be sent.\
\
   The appendix has been written to walk through the overall solution to\
   the problems presented in Sections 2 and 3.  There is mention of this\
   ResvTear transmission behavior in the appendix.\

\
\
5.1.  Partial Preemption Error Code\
\
   The ResvErr message generated due to preemption includes the\
   ERROR_SPEC object as well as the PREEMPTION_PRI object.  The format\
   of ERROR_SPEC objects is defined in [1].  The error code listed in\
   the ERROR_SPEC object for preemption [5] currently is as follows:\
\
         Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and\
         ErrSubCode = 5 (ERR_PREEMPT)\
\
   The following error code is suggested in the ERROR_SPEC object for\
   partial preemption:\
\
      Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and\
      ErrSubCode = 102 (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)\
\
   There is also an error code in the PREEMPTION-PRI object.  This error\
   code takes a value of 1 to indicate that the admitted flow was\
   preempted [3].  The same error value of 1 may be used for the partial\
   preemption case as well.\
\
5.2.  Error Flow Descriptor\
\
   The error flow descriptor is defined in [1] and [7].  In the case of\
   partial failure, the flowspec contained in the error flow descriptor\
   indicates the highest average and peak rates that the preempting\
   system can accept in the next RESV message.  The deaggregator must\
   reduce its reservation to a number less than or equal to that,\
   whether by changing codecs, dropping reservations, or some other\
   mechanism.\
\
5.3.  Individual Reservation Flow Reduction\
\
   When a router requires part of the bandwidth that has been allocated\
   to a reservation be used for another flow, the router engages in the\
   partial reduction of bandwidth as described in this document.  The\
   router sends a ResvErr downstream to indicate the partial error with\
   the error code and subcode as described in section 5.1.  The flowspec\
   contained in the ResvErr message will be used to indicate the\
   bandwidth that is currently allocated.\
\
   The requesting endpoint that receives the ResvErr can then negotiate\
   with the transmitting endpoint to lower the bandwidth requirement (by\
   selecting another lower bandwidth codec, for example).  After the\
   negotiations, both endpoints will issue the RSVP PATH and RESV\
   message with the new, lowered bandwidth.\

\
\
5.4.  Aggregation Reduction of Individual Flows\
\
   When a partial failure occurs in an aggregation scenario, the\
   deaggregator receives the ResvErr message with the reduction\
   indication from a router in the path of the aggregate.  It then\
   decides whether one or more individual flows from the aggregate are\
   to be affected by this ResvErr message.  The following choices are\
   possible:\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that one or more\
      individual flow(s) are to partially failed, then it sends a\
      ResvErr message with a reduced bandwidth indication to those\
      individual flow(s).  This is as per the descriptions in the\
      previous section (5.3).\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that one individual flow\
      is to be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it determines\
      which flow is affected.  That router transmits a new ResvErr\
      message downstream per [3].  That same router transmits a ResvTear\
      message upstream.  This ResvTear message of an individual flow\
      does not tear down the aggregate.  Only the individual flow is\
      affected.\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that multiple individual\
      flows are to be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it\
      chooses which flows are affected.  That router transmits a new\
      ResvErr message downstream as per [3] to each individual flow.\
      The router also transmits ResvTear messages upstream for the same\
      individual flows.  These ResvTear messages of an individual flow\
      do not tear down the aggregate.  Only the individual flows are\
      affected.\
\
   In all cases, the deaggregator lowers the bandwidth requested in the\
   Aggregate Resv message to reflect the change.\
\
   Which particular flow or series of flows within an aggregate are\
   picked by the deaggregator for bandwidth reduction or preemption is\
   outside the scope of this document.\
\
5.5.  RSVP Flow Reduction Involving IPsec Tunnels\
\
   RFC 2207 (per [8]) specifies how RSVP reservations function in IPsec\
   data flows.  The nodes initiating the IPsec flow can be an end-system\
   like a computer, or it can router between two end-systems, or it can\
   be an in-line bulk encryption device immediately adjacent to a router\
   interface; [11] directly addresses this later scenario.\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   The methods of identification of an IPsec with reservation flow are\
   different from non-encrypted flows, but how the reduction mechanism\
   specified within this document functions is not.\
\
   An IPsec with reservation flow is, for all intents and purposes,\
   considered an individual flow with regard to how to reduce the\
   bandwidth of the flow.  Obviously, an IPsec with reservation flow can\
   be a series of individual flows or disjointed best-effort packets\
   between two systems.  But to this specification, this tunnel is an\
   individual RSVP reservation.\
\
   Anywhere within this specification that mentions an individual\
   reservation flow, the same rules of bandwidth reduction and\
   preemption MUST apply.\
\
5.6.  Reduction of Multiple Flows at Once\
\
   As a cautionary note, bandwidth SHOULD NOT be reduced across multiple\
   reservations at the same time, in reaction to the same reduction\
   event.  A router not knowing the impact of reservation bandwidth\
   reduction on more than one flow may cause more widespread ill effects\
   than is necessary.\
\
   This says nothing to a policy where preemption should or should not\
   occur across multiple flows.\
\
6.  Backwards Compatibility\
\
   Backwards compatibility with this extension will result in RSVP\
   operating as it does without this extension, and no worse.  The two\
   routers involved in this extension are the router that had the\
   congested interface and the furthest downstream router that\
   determines what to do with the reduction indication.\
\
   In the case of the router that experiences congestion or otherwise\
   needs to reduce the bandwidth of an existing reservation:\
\
   - If that router supports this extension:\
\
     #1 - it generates the ResvErr message with the error code\
          indicating the reduction in bandwidth.\
\
     #2 - it does not generate the ResvTear message.\
\
   - If that router does not support this extension, it generates both\
     ResvErr and ResvTear messages according to [1].\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   In the case of the router at the extreme downstream of a reservation\
   that receives the ResvErr message with the reduction indication:\
\
   - If that router does support this extension:\
\
     #1 - it processes this error message and applies whatever local\
          policy it is configured to do to determine how to reduce the\
          bandwidth of this designated flow.\
\
   - If the router does not support this extension:\
\
     #1 - it processes the ResvErr message according to [1] and all\
          extensions it is able to understand, but not this extension\
          from this document.\
\
   Thus, this extension does not cause ill effects within RSVP if one or\
   more routers support this extension, and one or more routers do not\
   support this extension.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document does not lessen the overall security of RSVP or of\
   reservation flows through an aggregate.\
\
   If this specification is implemented poorly - which is never\
   intended, but is a consideration - the following issues may arise:\
\
   1) If the ResvTear messages are transmitted initially (at the same\
      time as the ResvErr messages indicating a reduction in bandwidth\
      is necessary), all upstream routers will tear down the entire\
      reservation.  This will free up the total amount of bandwidth of\
      this reservation inadvertently.  This may cause the re-\
      establishment of an otherwise good reservation to fail.  This has\
      the most severe affects on an aggregate that has many individual\
      flows that would have remained operational.\
\
   2) Just as RSVP has the vulnerability of premature termination of\
      valid reservations by rogue flows without authentication [12, 13],\
      this mechanism will have the same vulnerability.  Usage of RSVP\
      authentication mechanisms is encouraged.\

\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The IANA has assigned the following from RFC 4495 (i.e., this\
   document):\
\
   The following error code has been defined in the ERROR_SPEC object\
   for partial reservation failure under "Errcode = 2 (Policy Control\
   Failure)":\
\
      ErrSubCode = 102 (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)\
\
   The behavior of this ErrSubCode is defined in this document.\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Looking at Figure 2, aggregate X (with five 80 kbps flows) traverses:\
\
         R1 ==> R2 ==> R10 ==> R11 ==> R3 ==> R4\
\
   And aggregate Y (with five 80 kbps flows) traverses:\
\
         R5 ::> R6 ::> R10 ::> R11 ::> R7 ::> R8\
\
   Both aggregates are 400 kbps.  This totals 800 kbps at Int 7 in R10,\
   which is the maximum bandwidth that RSVP has access to at this\
   interface.  Signaling messages still traverse the interface without\
   problem.  Aggregate X is at a higher relative priority than aggregate\
   Y.  Local policy in this example is for higher relative priority\
   flows to preempt lower-priority flows during times of congestion.\
   The following points describe the flow when aggregate A is increased\
   to include Flow 9.\
\
   o  When Flow 9 (at 80 kbps) is added to aggregate X, R1 will initiate\
      the PATH message towards the destination endpoint of the flow.\
      This hop-by-hop message will take it through R2, R10, R11, R3, and\
      R4, which is the aggregate X path (that was built per [2] from the\
      aggregate's initial setup) to the endpoint node.\
\
   o  In response, R4 will generate the RESV (reservation) message\
      (defined behavior per [1]).  This RESV from the deaggregator\
      indicates an increase bandwidth sufficient to accommodate the\
      existing 5 flows (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and the new flow (9), as\
      stated in [2].\
\
   o  As mentioned before, in this example, Int 8 in R10 can only\
      accommodate 800 kbps, and aggregates X and Y have each already\
      established 400 kbps flows comprised of five 80 kbps individual\
      flows.  Therefore, R10 (the interface that detects a congestion\
      event in this example) must make a decision about this new\
      congestion generating condition in regard to the RESV message\
      received at Int 8.\
\
   o  Local policy in this scenario is to preempt lower-priority\
      reservations to place higher-priority reservations.  This would\
      normally cause all of aggregate Y to be preempted just to\
      accommodate aggregate X's request for an additional 80 kbps.\
\
   o  This document defines how aggregate Y is not completely preempted,\
      but reduced in bandwidth by 80 kbps.  This is contained in the\
      ResvErr message that R10 generates (downstream) towards R11, R7,\
      and R8.  See section 5 for the details of the error message.\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   o  Normal operation of RSVP is to have the router that generates a\
      ResvErr message downstream to also generate a ResvTear message\
      upstream (in the opposite direction, i.e., towards R5).  The\
      ResvTear message terminates an individual flow or aggregate flow.\
      This document calls for that message not to be sent on any partial\
      failure of reservation.\
\
   o  R8 is the deaggregator of aggregate Y.  The deaggregator controls\
      all the parameters of an aggregate reservation.  This will be the\
      node that reduces the necessary bandwidth of the aggregate as a\
      response to the reception of an ResvErr message (from R10)\
      indicating such an action is called for.  In this example,\
      bandwidth reduction is accomplished by preempting an individual\
      flow within the aggregate (perhaps picking on Flow D for\
      individual preemption by generating a ResvErr downstream on that\
      individual flow).\
\
   o  At the same time, a ResvTear message is transmitted upstream on\
      that individual flow (Flow D) by R8.  This will not affect the\
      aggregate directly, but is an indication to the routers (and the\
      source end-system) which individual flow is to be preempted.\
\
   o  Once R8 preempts whichever individual flow (or 'bandwidth' at the\
      aggregate ingress), it transmits a new RESV message for that\
      aggregate (Y), not for a new aggregate.  This RESV from the\
      deaggregator indicates a decrease in bandwidth sufficient to\
      accommodate the remaining 4 flows (A, B, C, and E), which is now\
      320 kbps (in this example).\
\
   o  This RESV message travels the entire path of the reservation,\
      resetting all routers to this new aggregate bandwidth value.  This\
      should be what is necessary to prevent a ResvTear message from\
      being generated by R10 towards R6 and R5.\
\
   R5 will not know through this RESV message which individual flow was\
   preempted.  If in this example, R8 was given more bandwidth to keep,\
   it might have transmitted a bandwidth reduction ResvErr indication\
   towards the end-system of Flow D.  In that case, a voice signaling\
   protocol (such as SIP) could have attempted a renegotiation of that\
   individual flow to a reduced bandwidth (say, but changing the voice\
   codec from G.711 to G. 729).  This could have saved Flow D from\
   preemption.\

RFC 4491                  Using GOST with PKIX                  May 2006\
\
\
   This specification defines the contents of the signatureAlgorithm,\
   signatureValue, signature, and subjectPublicKeyInfo fields within\
   X.509 Certificates and CRLs.  For each algorithm, the appropriate\
   alternatives for the keyUsage certificate extension are provided.\
\
   ASN.1 modules, including all the definitions used in this document,\
   can be found in [CPALGS].\
\
1.1.  Requirement Words\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Algorithm Support\
\
   This section is an overview of cryptographic algorithms that may be\
   used within the Internet X.509 certificates and CRL profile\
   [PROFILE].  It describes one-way hash functions and digital signature\
   algorithms that may be used to sign certificates and CRLs, and it\
   identifies object identifiers (OIDs) and ASN.1 encoding for public\
   keys contained in a certificate.\
\
   Certification authorities (CAs) and/or applications conforming to\
   this standard MUST support at least one of the specified public key\
   and signature algorithms.\
\
2.1.  One-Way Hash Function\
\
   This section describes the use of a one-way, collision-free hash\
   function GOST R 34.11-94, the only one that can be used in the\
   digital signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-94/2001.  The data that is\
   hashed for certificates and CRL signing is fully described in RFC\
   3280 [PROFILE].\
\
2.1.1.  One-Way Hash Function GOST R 34.11-94\
\
   GOST R 34.11-94 has been developed by "GUBS of Federal Agency\
   Government Communication and Information" and "All-Russian Scientific\
   and Research Institute of Standardization".  The algorithm GOST R\
   34.11-94 produces a 256-bit hash value of an arbitrary finite bit\
   length input.  This document does not contain the full GOST R 34.11-\
   94 specification, which can be found in [GOSTR341194] (in Russian).\
   [Schneier95], ch. 18.11, p. 454, contains a brief technical\
   description in English.\
\
   This function MUST always be used with parameter set identified by\
   id-GostR3411-94-CryptoProParamSet (see Section 8.2 of [CPALGS]).\

\
\
2.2.  Signature Algorithms\
\
   Conforming CAs may use GOST R 34.10-94 or GOST R 34.10-2001 signature\
   algorithms to sign certificates and CRLs.\
\
   These signature algorithms MUST always be used with a one-way hash\
   function GOST R 34.11-94 as indicated in [GOSTR341094] and\
   [GOSTR341001].\
\
   This section defines algorithm identifiers and parameters to be used\
   in the signatureAlgorithm field in a Certificate or CertificateList.\
\
2.2.1.  Signature Algorithm GOST R 34.10-94\
\
   GOST R 34.10-94 has been developed by "GUBS of Federal Agency\
   Government Communication and Information" and "All-Russian Scientific\
   and Research Institute of Standardization".  This document does not\
   contain the full GOST R 34.10-94 specification, which can be found in\
   [GOSTR341094] (in Russian).  [Schneier95], ch. 20.3, p. 495, contains\
   a brief technical description in English.\
\
   The ASN.1 object identifier used to identify this signature algorithm\
   is:\
\
   id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-94 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
         { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           gostR3411-94-with-gostR3410-94(4) }\
\
   When the id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-94 algorithm identifier\
   appears as the algorithm field in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the\
   encoding SHALL omit the parameters field.  That is, the\
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component: the OBJECT\
   IDENTIFIER id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-94.\
\
   The signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-94 generates a digital signature\
   in the form of two 256-bit numbers, r' and s.  Its octet string\
   representation consists of 64 octets, where the first 32 octets\
   contain the big-endian representation of s and the second 32 octets\
   contain the big-endian representation of r'.\
\
   This definition of a signature value is directly usable in CMS [CMS],\
   where such values are represented as octet strings.  However,\
   signature values in certificates and CRLs [PROFILE] are represented\
   as bit strings, and thus the octet string representation must be\
   converted.\

RFC 4491                  Using GOST with PKIX                  May 2006\
\
\
   To convert an octet string signature value to a bit string, the most\
   significant bit of the first octet of the signature value SHALL\
   become the first bit of the bit string, and so on through the least\
   significant bit of the last octet of the signature value, which SHALL\
   become the last bit of the bit string.\
\
2.2.2.  Signature Algorithm GOST R 34.10-2001\
\
   GOST R 34.10-2001 was developed by "GUBS of Federal Agency Government\
   Communication and Information" and "All-Russian Scientific and\
   Research Institute of Standardization".  This document does not\
   contain the full GOST R 34.10-2001 specification, which can be found\
   in [GOSTR341001] (in Russian).\
\
   The ASN.1 object identifier used to identify this signature algorithm\
   is:\
\
   id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-2001 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
         { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           gostR3411-94-with-gostR3410-2001(3) }\
\
   When the id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-2001 algorithm identifier\
   appears as the algorithm field in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the\
   encoding SHALL omit the parameters field.  That is, the\
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component: the OBJECT\
   IDENTIFIER id-GostR3411-94-with-GostR3410-2001.\
\
   The signature algorithm GOST R 34.10-2001 generates a digital\
   signature in the form of two 256-bit numbers, r and s.  Its octet\
   string representation consists of 64 octets, where the first 32\
   octets contain the big-endian representation of s and the second 32\
   octets contain the big-endian representation of r.\
\
   The process described above (Section 2.2.1) MUST be used to convert\
   this octet string representation to a bit string for use in\
   certificates and CRLs.\
\
2.3.  Subject Public Key Algorithms\
\
   This section defines OIDs and public key parameters for public keys\
   that employ the GOST R 34.10-94 [GOSTR341094]/VKO GOST R 34.10-94\
   [CPALGS] or the GOST R 34.10-2001 [GOSTR341001]/VKO GOST R 34.10-2001\
   [CPALGS] algorithms.\
\
   Use of the same key for both signature and key derivation is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED.  The intended application for the key MAY be indicated\
   in the keyUsage certificate extension (see [PROFILE], Section\
   4.2.1.3).\

\
\
2.3.1.  GOST R 34.10-94 Keys\
\
   GOST R 34.10-94 public keys can be used for the signature algorithm\
   GOST R 34.10-94 [GOSTR341094] and for the key derivation algorithm\
   VKO GOST R 34.10-94 [CPALGS].\
\
   GOST R 34.10-94 public keys are identified by the following OID:\
\
   id-GostR3410-94 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\
       { iso(1) member-body(2) ru(643) rans(2) cryptopro(2)\
           gostR3410-94(20) }\
\
   The SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm.algorithm field (see RFC 3280\
   [PROFILE]) for GOST R 34.10-94 keys MUST be set to id-GostR3410-94.\
\
   When the id-GostR3410-94 algorithm identifier appears as the\
   algorithm field in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding MAY omit the\
   parameters field or set it to NULL.  Otherwise, this field MUST have\
   the following structure:\
\
    GostR3410-94-PublicKeyParameters ::=\
        SEQUENCE {\
            publicKeyParamSet\
                OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\
            digestParamSet\
                OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\
            encryptionParamSet\
                OBJECT IDENTIFIER DEFAULT\
                    id-Gost28147-89-CryptoPro-A-ParamSet\
        }\
\
   where:\
\
   * publicKeyParamSet - public key parameters identifier for GOST R\
     34.10-94 (see Section 8.3 of [CPALGS])\
   * digestParamSet - parameters identifier for GOST R 34.11-94 (see\
     Section 8.2 of [CPALGS])\
   * encryptionParamSet - parameters identifier for GOST 28147-89\
     [GOST28147] (see Section 8.1 of [CPALGS])\
\
   The absence of parameters SHALL be processed as described in RFC 3280\
   [PROFILE], Section 6.1; that is, parameters are inherited from the\
   issuer certificate.  When the working_public_key_parameters variable\
   is set to null, the certificate and any signature verifiable on this\
   certificate SHALL be rejected.\

\
\
   The GOST R 34.10-94 public key MUST be ASN.1 DER encoded as an OCTET\
   STRING; this encoding shall be used as the contents (i.e., the value)\
   of the subjectPublicKey component (a BIT STRING) of the\
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo data element.\
\
   GostR3410-94-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING -- public key, Y\
\
   GostR3410-94-PublicKey MUST contain 128 octets of the little-endian\
   representation of the public key Y = a^x (mod p), where a and p are\
   public key parameters, and x is a private key.\
\
   Some erroneous applications discard zero bits at the end of BIT\
   STRING containing the public key.  It is RECOMMENDED to pad the bit\
   string with zeroes up to 1048 bits (131 octets) on decoding to be\
   able to decode the encapsulated OCTET STRING.\
\
   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate\
   that contains a GOST R 34.10-94 public key, the following values MAY\
   be present:\
\
      digitalSignature;\
      nonRepudiation;\
      keyEncipherment; and\
      keyAgreement.\
\
   If the keyAgreement or keyEnchiperment extension is present in a\
   certificate GOST R 34.10-94 public key, the following values MAY be\
   present as well:\
\
      encipherOnly; and\
      decipherOnly.\
\
   The keyUsage extension MUST NOT assert both encipherOnly and\
   decipherOnly.\
\
   If the keyUsage extension is present in an CA or CRL signer\
   certificate that contains a GOST R 34.10-94 public key, the following\
   values MAY be present:\
\
      digitalSignature;\
      nonRepudiation;\
      keyCertSign; and\
      cRLSign.\

\
   GOST R 34.10-2001 public keys can be used for the signature algorithm\

RFC 4491                  Using GOST with PKIX                  May 2006\
\
\
   The GOST R 34.10-2001 public key MUST be ASN.1 DER encoded as an\
   OCTET STRING; this encoding shall be used as the contents (i.e., the\
   value) of the subjectPublicKey component (a BIT STRING) of the\
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo data element.\
\
   GostR3410-2001-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING -- public key vector, Q\
\
   According to [GOSTR341001], a public key is a point on the elliptic\
   curve Q = (x,y).\
\
   GostR3410-2001-PublicKey MUST contain 64 octets, where the first 32\
   octets contain the little-endian representation of x and the second\
   32 octets contain the little-endian representation of y.  This\
   corresponds to the binary representation of (<y>256||<x>256) from\
   [GOSTR341001], ch.  5.3.\
\
   Some erroneous applications discard zero bits at the end of BIT\
   STRING containing the public key.  It is RECOMMENDED to pad the bit\
   string with zeroes up to 528 bits (66 octets) on decoding to be able\
   to decode the encapsulated OCTET STRING.\
\
   The same keyUsage constraints apply for use of GOST R 34.10-2001 keys\
   as described in Section 2.3.1 for GOST R 34.10-94 keys.\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that applications verify signature values and\
   subject public keys to conform to [GOSTR341001, GOSTR341094]\
   standards prior to their use.\
\
   When a certificate is used to support digital signatures as an\
   analogue to manual ("wet") signatures, in the context of Russian\
   Federal Electronic Digital Signature Law [RFEDSL], the certificate\
   MUST contain keyUsage extension, it MUST be critical, and keyUsage\
   MUST NOT include keyEncipherment and keyAgreement.\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED that CAs and applications make sure that the\
   private key for creating signatures is not used for more than its\
   allowed validity period (typically 15 months for both the GOST R\
   34.10-94 and GOST R 34.10-2001 algorithms).\
\
   For security discussion concerning use of algorithm parameters, see\
   the Security Considerations section in [CPALGS].\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has\
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code\
   (CMAC).  CMAC [NIST-CMAC] is a keyed hash function that is based on a\
   symmetric key block cipher, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard\
   [NIST-AES].  CMAC is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1)\
   submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa [OMAC1a, OMAC1b].  OMAC1 is an\
   improvement of the eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC)\
   submitted by Black and Rogaway [XCBCa, XCBCb], which itself is an\
   improvement of the basic Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication\
   Code (CBC-MAC).  XCBC efficiently addresses the security deficiencies\
   of CBC-MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of XCBC.\
\
   AES-CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity than a\
   checksum or an error-detecting code.  The verification of a checksum\
   or an error-detecting code detects only accidental modifications of\
   the data, while CMAC is designed to detect intentional, unauthorized\
   modifications of the data, as well as accidental modifications.\
\
   AES-CMAC achieves a security goal similar to that of HMAC [RFC-HMAC].\
   Since AES-CMAC is based on a symmetric key block cipher, AES, and\
   HMAC is based on a hash function, such as SHA-1, AES-CMAC is\
   appropriate for information systems in which AES is more readily\
   available than a hash function.\
\
   This memo specifies the authentication algorithm based on CMAC with\
   AES-128.  This new authentication algorithm is named AES-CMAC.\

2.  Specification of AES-CMAC\
\
2.1.  Basic Definitions\
\
   The following table describes the basic definitions necessary to\
   explain the specification of AES-CMAC.\
\
   x || y          Concatenation.\
                   x || y is the string x concatenated with the string\
                   y.\
                   0000 || 1111 is 00001111.\
\
   x XOR y         Exclusive-OR operation.\
                   For two equal length strings, x and y,\
                   x XOR y is their bit-wise exclusive-OR.\
\
   ceil(x)         Ceiling function.\
                   The smallest integer no smaller than x.\
                   ceil(3.5) is 4.  ceil(5) is 5.\
\
   x << 1          Left-shift of the string x by 1 bit.\
                   The most significant bit disappears, and a zero\
                   comes into the least significant bit.\
                   10010001 << 1 is 00100010.\
\
   0^n             The string that consists of n zero-bits.\
                   0^3 means 000 in binary format.\
                   10^4 means 10000 in binary format.\
                   10^i means 1 followed by i-times repeated\
                   zeros.\
\
   MSB(x)          The most-significant bit of the string x.\
                   MSB(10010000) means 1.\
\
   padding(x)      10^i padded output of input x.\
                   It is described in detail in section 2.4.\
\
   Key             128-bit (16-octet) long key for AES-128.\
                   Denoted by K.\
\
   First subkey    128-bit (16-octet) long first subkey,\
                   derived through the subkey\
                   generation algorithm from the key K.\

\
   Message         A message to be authenticated.\
                   Denoted by M.\
                   The message can be null, which means that the length\
                   of M is 0.\
\
   Message length  The length of the message M in octets.\
                   Denoted by len.\
                   The minimum value of the length can be 0.  The\
                   maximum value of the length is not specified in\
                   this document.\
\
   AES-128(K,M)    AES-128(K,M) is the 128-bit ciphertext of AES-128\
                   for a 128-bit key, K, and a 128-bit message, M.\
\
   MAC             A 128-bit string that is the output of AES-CMAC.\
                   Denoted by T.\
                   Validating the MAC provides assurance of the\
                   integrity and authenticity of the message from\
                   the source.\
\
   MAC length      By default, the length of the output of AES-CMAC is\
                   128 bits.  It is possible to truncate the MAC.\
                   The result of the truncation should be taken in most\
                   significant bits first order.  The MAC length must be\
                   specified before the communication starts, and\
                   it must not be changed during the lifetime of the\
                   key.\
\
2.2.  Overview\
\
   AES-CMAC uses the Advanced Encryption Standard [NIST-AES] as a\
   building block.  To generate a MAC, AES-CMAC takes a secret key, a\
   message of variable length, and the length of the message in octets\
   as inputs and returns a fixed-bit string called a MAC.\
\
   The core of AES-CMAC is the basic CBC-MAC.  For a message, M, to be\
   authenticated, the CBC-MAC is applied to M.  There are two cases of\
   operation in CMAC.  Figure 2.1 illustrates the operation of CBC-MAC\
   in both cases.  If the size of the input message block is equal to a\
   positive multiple of the block size (namely, 128 bits), the last\
   block shall be exclusive-OR'ed with K1 before processing.  Otherwise,\
   the last block shall be padded with 10^i (notation is described in\
   section 2.1) and exclusive-OR'ed with K2.  The result of the previous\

   process will be the input of the last encryption.  The output of\
   AES-CMAC provides data integrity of the whole input message.\

          Figure 2.1.  Illustration of the two cases of AES-CMAC\
\
   AES_K is AES-128 with key K.\
   The message M is divided into blocks M_1,...,M_n,\
   where M_i is the i-th message block.\
   The length of M_i is 128 bits for i = 1,...,n-1, and\
   the length of the last block, M_n, is less than or equal to 128 bits.\
   K1 is the subkey for the case (a), and\
   K2 is the subkey for the case (b).\
   K1 and K2 are generated by the subkey generation algorithm\
   described in section 2.3.\
\
2.3.  Subkey Generation Algorithm\
\
   The subkey generation algorithm, Generate_Subkey(), takes a secret\
   key, K, which is just the key for AES-128.\
\
   The outputs of the subkey generation algorithm are two subkeys, K1\
   and K2.  We write (K1,K2) := Generate_Subkey(K).\
\
   Subkeys K1 and K2 are used in both MAC generation and MAC\
   verification algorithms.  K1 is used for the case where the length of\
   the last block is equal to the block length.  K2 is used for the case\
   where the length of the last block is less than the block length.\

\
2.4.  MAC Generation Algorithm\
\
   The MAC generation algorithm, AES-CMAC(), takes three inputs, a\
   secret key, a message, and the length of the message in octets.  The\
   secret key, denoted by K, is just the key for AES-128.  The message\
   and its length in octets are denoted by M and len, respectively.  The\
   message M is denoted by the sequence of M_i, where M_i is the i-th\
   message block.  That is, if M consists of n blocks, then M is written\
   as\
\
    -   M = M_1 || M_2 || ... || M_{n-1} || M_n\
\
   The length of M_i is 128 bits for i = 1,...,n-1, and the length of\
   the last block M_n is less than or equal to 128 bits.\
\
   The output of the MAC generation algorithm is a 128-bit string,\
   called a MAC, which is used to validate the input message.  The MAC\
   is denoted by T, and we write T := AES-CMAC(K,M,len).  Validating the\
   MAC provides assurance of the integrity and authenticity of the\
   message from the source.\
\
   It is possible to truncate the MAC.  According to [NIST-CMAC], at\
   least a 64-bit MAC should be used as protection against guessing\
   attacks.  The result of truncation should be taken in most\
   significant bits first order.\
\
   The block length of AES-128 is 128 bits (16 octets).  There is a\
   special treatment if the length of the message is not a positive\
   multiple of the block length.  The special treatment is to pad M with\
   the bit-string 10^i to adjust the length of the last block up to the\
   block length.\
\
   For an input string x of r-octets, where 0 <= r < 16, the padding\
   function, padding(x), is defined as follows:\
\
   -   padding(x) = x || 10^i      where i is 128-8*r-1\
\
   That is, padding(x) is the concatenation of x and a single '1',\
   followed by the minimum number of '0's, so that the total length is\
   equal to 128 bits.\
\
   Figure 2.3 describes the MAC generation algorithm.\

\
\
   In step 1, subkeys K1 and K2 are derived from K through the subkey\
   generation algorithm.\
\
   In step 2, the number of blocks, n, is calculated.  The number of\
   blocks is the smallest integer value greater than or equal to the\
   quotient determined by dividing the length parameter by the block\
   length, 16 octets.\
\
   In step 3, the length of the input message is checked.  If the input\
   length is 0 (null), the number of blocks to be processed shall be 1,\
   and the flag shall be marked as not-complete-block (false).\
   Otherwise, if the last block length is 128 bits, the flag is marked\
   as complete-block (true); else mark the flag as not-complete-block\
   (false).\
\
   In step 4, M_last is calculated by exclusive-OR'ing M_n and one of\
   the previously calculated subkeys.  If the last block is a complete\
   block (true), then M_last is the exclusive-OR of M_n and K1.\
   Otherwise, M_last is the exclusive-OR of padding(M_n) and K2.\
\
   In step 5, the variable X is initialized.\
\
   In step 6, the basic CBC-MAC is applied to M_1,...,M_{n-1},M_last.\
\
   In step 7, the 128-bit MAC, T := AES-CMAC(K,M,len), is returned.\
\
   If necessary, the MAC is truncated before it is returned.\
\
2.5.  MAC Verification Algorithm\
\
   The verification of the MAC is simply done by a MAC recomputation.\
   We use the MAC generation algorithm, which is described in section\
   2.4.\
\
   The MAC verification algorithm, Verify_MAC(), takes four inputs, a\
   secret key, a message, the length of the message in octets, and the\
   received MAC.  These are denoted by K, M, len, and T', respectively.\
\
   The output of the MAC verification algorithm is either INVALID or\
   VALID.\
\
   Figure 2.4 describes the MAC verification algorithm.\

\
   In step 1, T* is derived from K, M, and len through the MAC\
   generation algorithm.\
\
   In step 2, T* and T' are compared.  If T* is equal to T', then return\
   VALID; otherwise return INVALID.\
\
   If the output is INVALID, then the message is definitely not\
   authentic, i.e., it did not originate from a source that executed the\
   generation process on the message to produce the purported MAC.\
\
   If the output is VALID, then the design of the AES-CMAC provides\
   assurance that the message is authentic and, hence, was not corrupted\
   in transit; however, this assurance, as for any MAC algorithm, is not\
   absolute.\
\
3.  Security Considerations\
\
   The security provided by AES-CMAC is built on the strong\
   cryptographic algorithm AES.  However, as is true with any\
   cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength lies in the secret key,\
   K, and the correctness of the implementation in all of the\
   participating systems.  If the secret key is compromised or\
   inappropriately shared, it guarantees neither authentication nor\
   integrity of message at all.  The secret key shall be generated in a\
   way that meets the pseudo randomness requirement of RFC 4086\
   [RFC4086] and should be kept safe.  If and only if AES-CMAC is used\

   best current practice of message authentication.\

Abstract\
\
   This document captures the issues that may arise in the deployment of\
   IPv6 networks when they support Mobile IPv6 and firewalls.  The\
   issues are not only applicable to firewalls protecting enterprise\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Network elements such as firewalls are an integral aspect of a\
   majority of IP networks today, given the state of security in the\
   Internet, threats, and vulnerabilities to data networks.  Current IP\
   networks are predominantly based on IPv4 technology, and hence\
   firewalls have been designed for these networks.  Deployment of IPv6\
   networks is currently progressing, albeit at a slower pace.\
   Firewalls for IPv6 networks are still maturing and in development.\
\
   Mobility support for IPv6 has been standardized as specified in RFC\
   3775.  Given the fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent standard, most\
   firewalls available for IPv6 networks do not support Mobile IPv6.\
\
   Unless firewalls are aware of Mobile IPv6 protocol details, these\
   security devices will interfere with the smooth operation of the\
   protocol and can be a detriment to deployment.\
\
   Mobile IPv6 enables IP mobility for IPv6 nodes.  It allows a mobile\
   IPv6 node to be reachable via its home IPv6 address irrespective of\
   any link that the mobile attaches to.  This is possible as a result\
   of the extensions to IPv6 defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification\
   [1].\
\
   Mobile IPv6 protocol design also incorporates a feature termed Route\
   Optimization.  This set of extensions is a fundamental part of the\
   protocol that enables optimized routing of packets between a mobile\
   node and its correspondent node and therefore optimized performance\
   of the communication.\
\
   In most cases, current firewall technologies, however, do not support\
   Mobile IPv6 or are not even aware of Mobile IPv6 headers and\
   extensions.  Since most networks in the current business environment\
   deploy firewalls, this may prevent future large-scale deployment of\
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol.\
\
   This document presents in detail some of the issues that firewalls\
   present for Mobile IPv6 deployment, as well as the impact of each\
   issue.\

2.  Terminology\
\
   Return Routability Test (RRT): The Return Routability Test is a\
      procedure defined in RFC 3775 [1].  It is performed prior to the\
      Route Optimization (RO), where a mobile node (MN) instructs a\
      correspondent node (CN) to direct the mobile node's data traffic\
      to its claimed care-of address (CoA).  The Return Routability\
      procedure provides some security assurance and prevents the misuse\
      of Mobile IPv6 signaling to maliciously redirect the traffic or to\
      launch other attacks.\

4.  Overview of Firewalls\
\
   The following section provides a brief overview of firewalls.  It is\
   intended as background information so that issues with the Mobile\
   IPv6 protocol can then be presented in detail in the following\
   sections.\
\
   There are different types of firewalls, and state can be created in\
   these firewalls through different methods.  Independent of the\
   adopted method, firewalls typically look at five parameters of the\
   traffic arriving at the firewalls:\
\

\
\
   o  Source IP address\
\
   o  Destination IP address\
\
   o  Protocol type\
\
   o  Source port number\
\
   o  Destination port number\
\
   Based on these parameters, firewalls usually decide whether to allow\
   the traffic or to drop the packets.  Some firewalls may filter only\
   incoming traffic, while others may also filter outgoing traffic.\
\
   According to Section 3.29 of RFC 2647 [2], stateful packet filtering\
   refers to the process of forwarding or rejecting traffic based on the\
   contents of a state table maintained by a firewall.  These types of\
   firewalls are commonly deployed to protect networks from different\
   threats, such as blocking unsolicited incoming traffic from the\
   external networks.  The following briefly describes how these\
   firewalls work since they can create additional problems with the\
   Mobile IPv6 protocol as described in the subsequent sections.\
\
   In TCP, an MN sends a TCP SYN message to connect to another host in\
   the Internet.\
\
   Upon receiving that SYN packet, the firewall records the source IP\
   address, the destination IP address, the Protocol type, the source\
   port number, and the destination port number indicated in that packet\
   before transmitting it to the destination.\
\
   When an incoming message from the external networks reaches the\
   firewall, it searches the packet's source IP address, destination IP\
   address, Protocol type, source port number, and destination port\
   number in its entries to see if the packet matches the\
   characteristics of a request sent previously.  If so, the firewall\
   allows the packet to enter the network.  If the packet was not\
   solicited from an internal node, the packet is blocked.\
\
   When the TCP close session packets are exchanged or after some\
   configurable period of inactivity, the associated entry in the\
   firewall is deleted.  This mechanism prevents entries from remaining\
   when TCP are abruptly terminated.\
\
   A similar entry is created when using UDP.  The difference with this\
   transport protocol is that UDP is connectionless and does not have\
   packets signaling the initiation or termination of a session.\
   Consequently, the duration of the entries relies solely on timers.\

\
5.  Analysis of Various Scenarios Involving MIP6 Nodes and Firewalls\
\
   The following section describes various scenarios involving MIP6\
   nodes and firewalls and also presents the issues related to each\
   scenario.\
\
   The Mobile IPv6 specifications define three main entities: the mobile\
   node (MN), the correspondent node (CN), and the home agent (HA).\
   Each of these entities may be in a network protected by one or many\
   firewalls:\
\
   o  Section 5.1 analyzes the issues when the MN is in a network\
      protected by firewall(s)\
\
   o  Section 5.2 analyzes the issues when the CN is in a network\
      protected by firewall(s)\
\
   o  Section 5.3 analyzes the issues when the HA is in a network\
      protected by firewall(s)\
\
   The MN may also be moving from an external network, to a network\
   protected by firewall(s).  The issues of this case are described in\
   Section 5.4.\
\
   Some of the described issues (e.g., Sections 5.1 and 5.2) may require\
   modifications to the protocols or to the firewalls, and others (e.g.,\
   Section 5.3) may require only that appropriate rules and\
   configuration be in place.\

5.1.  Scenario Where the Mobile Node Is in a Network Protected by\
      Firewall(s)\
\
   Let's consider MN A, in a network protected by firewall(s).\

     +----------------+\
     Network protected\
\
   Figure 1: Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when MN is in a network\
             protected by firewalls\
\
   A number of issues need to be considered:\
\
   Issue 1: When MN A connects to the network, it should acquire a local\
      IP address (CoA) and send a Binding Update (BU) to its Home Agent\
      to update the HA with its current point of attachment.  The\
      Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should be protected by IPsec\
      ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [1].  However, as a\
      default rule, many firewalls drop IPsec ESP packets because they\
      cannot determine whether inbound ESP packets are legitimate.  It\
      is difficult or impossible to create useful state by observing the\
      outbound ESP packets.  This may cause the Binding Updates and\
      Acknowledgements between the mobile nodes and their home agent to\
      be dropped.\
\
   Issue 2: Let's now consider a node in the external network, B, trying\
      to establish a communication with MN A.\
\
      *  B sends a packet to the mobile node's home address.\
\
      *  The packet is intercepted by the MN's home agent, which tunnels\
         it to the MN's CoA [1].\
\
      *  When arriving at the firewall(s) protecting MN A, the packet\
         may be dropped since the incoming packet may not match any\
         existing state.  As described in Section 4, stateful inspection\
         packet filters (for example) typically drop unsolicited\
         incoming traffic.\

\
\
      *  B will thus not be able to contact MN A and establish a\
         communication.\
\
      Even though the HA is updated with the location of an MN,\
      firewalls may prevent correspondent nodes from establishing\
      communications when the MN is in a network protected by\
      firewall(s).\
\
   Issue 3: Let's assume a communication between MN A and an external\
      node B.  MN A may want to use Route Optimization (RO) so that\
      packets can be directly exchanged between the MN and the CN\
      without passing through the HA.  However, the firewalls protecting\
      the MN might present issues with the Return Routability procedure\
      that needs to be performed prior to using RO.\
\
      According to the MIPv6 specifications, the Home Test message of\
      the RRT must be protected by IPsec in tunnel mode.  However,\
      firewalls might drop any packet protected by ESP, since the\
      firewalls cannot analyze the packets encrypted by ESP (e.g., port\
      numbers).  The firewalls may thus drop the Home Test messages and\
      prevent the completion of the RRT procedure.\
\
   Issue 4: Let's assume that MN A successfully sends a Binding Update\
      to its home agent (resp. correspondent nodes) -- which solves\
      issue 1 (resp. issue 3) -- and that the subsequent traffic is sent\
      from the HA (resp. CN) to the MN's CoA.  However there may not be\
      any corresponding state in the firewalls.  The firewalls\
      protecting A may thus drop the incoming packets.\
\
      The appropriate states for the traffic to the MN's CoA need to be\
      created in the firewall(s).\
\
   Issue 5: When MN A moves, it may move to a link that is served by a\
      different firewall.  MN A might be sending a BU to its CN;\
      however, incoming packets may be dropped at the firewall, since\
      the firewall on the new link that the MN attaches to does not have\
      any state that is associated with the MN.\
\
   The issues described above result from the fact that the MN is behind\
   the firewall.  Consequently, the MN's communication capability with\
   other nodes is affected by the firewall rules.\

\
5.2.  Scenario Where the Correspondent Node Is in a Network Protected by\
      Firewall(s)\
\
   Let's consider an MN in a network, communicating with a Correspondent\
   Node C in a network protected by firewall(s).  There are no issues\
   with the presence of a firewall in the scenario where the MN is\
   sending packets to the CN via a reverse tunnel that is set up between\
   the MN and HA.  However, firewalls may present different issues to\
   Route Optimization.\

       by a firewall\
\
   Figure 2: Issues between MIP6 and firewalls when a CN is in a network\
             protected by firewalls\
\
   The following issues need to be considered:\
\
   Issue 1: The MN (MN B) should use its Home Address (HoA B) when\
      establishing the communication with the CN (CN C), if MN B wants\
      to take advantage of the mobility support provided by the Mobile\
      IPv6 protocol for its communication with CN C.  The state created\
      by the firewall protecting CN C is therefore created based on the\
      IP address of C (IP C) and the home address of Node B (IP HoA B).\
      The states may be created via different means, and the protocol\
      type as well as the port numbers depend on the connection setup.\

\
            Source Port Number: #2\
\
            Destination Port Number: #1\
\
      Nodes C and B might be topologically close to each other, while\
      B's home agent may be far away, resulting in a trombone effect\
      that can create delay and degrade the performance.  MN B may\
      decide to initiate the route optimization procedure with Node C.\
      Route optimization requires MN B to send a Binding Update to Node\
      C in order to create an entry in its binding cache that maps the\
      MN's home address to its current care-of-address.  However, prior\
      to sending the binding update, the mobile node must first execute\
      a Return Routability Test:\
\
      *  Mobile Node B has to send a Home Test Init (HoTI) message via\
         its home agent and\
\
      *  a Care of Test Init (COTI) message directly to its\
         Correspondent Node C.\
\
      The Care of Test Init message is sent using the CoA of B as the\
      source address.  Such a packet does not match any entry in the\
      protecting firewall (2).  The CoTi message will thus be dropped by\
      the firewall.\
\
      The HoTI is a Mobility Header packet, and as the protocol type\
      differs from the established state in the firewall (see (2)), the\
      HoTI packet will also be dropped.\
\
      As a consequence, the RRT cannot be completed, and route\
      optimization cannot be applied.  Every packet has to go through\
      Node B's home agent and tunneled between B's home agent and B.\

\
   Issue 2: Let's assume that the Binding Update to the CN is\
      successful; the firewall(s) might still drop packets that are:\
\
      1.  coming from the CoA, since these incoming packets are sent\
          from the CoA and do not match the Downlink Packet filter (2).\
\
      2.  sent from the CN to the CoA if uplink packet filters are\
          implemented.  The uplink packets are sent to the MN's CoA and\
          do not match the uplink packet filter (1).\
\
      The packet filters for the traffic sent to (resp. from) the CoA\
      need to be created in the firewall(s).\
\
      Requiring the firewalls to update the connection state upon\
      detecting Binding Update messages from a node outside the network\
      protected by the firewall does not appear feasible or desirable,\
      since currently the firewall does not have any means to verify the\
      validity of Binding Update messages and therefore to modify the\
      state information securely.  Changing the firewall states without\
      verifying the validity of the Binding Update messages could lead\
      to denial of service attacks.  Malicious nodes may send fake\
      binding updates, forcing the firewall to change its state\
      information, and therefore leading the firewall to drop packets\
      from the connections that use the legitimate addresses.  An\
      adversary might also use an address update to enable its own\
      traffic to pass through the firewall and enter the network.\
\
   Issue 3: Let's assume that the Binding Update to the CN is\
      successful.  The CN may be protected by different firewalls, and\
      as a result of the MN's change of IP address, incoming and\
      outgoing traffic may pass through a different firewall.  The new\

\
\
      firewall may not have any state associated with the CN, and\
      incoming packets (and potentially outgoing traffic as well) may be\
      dropped at the firewall.\
\
      Firewall technology allows clusters of firewalls to share state\
      [3].  This, for example, allows the support of routing asymmetry.\
      However, if the previous and the new firewalls, through which the\
      packets are routed after the Binding Update has been sent, do not\
      share state, this may result in packets being dropped at the new\
      firewall.  As the new firewall does not have any state associated\
      with the CN, incoming packets (and potentially outgoing traffic as\
      well) may be dropped at the new firewall.\
\
5.3.  Scenario Where the HA Is in a Network Protected by Firewall(s)\
\
   In the scenarios where the home agent is in a network protected by\
   firewall(s), the following issues may exist:\
\
   Issue 1: If the firewall(s) protecting the home agent block ESP\
      traffic, much of the MIPv6 signaling (e.g., Binding Update, HoT)\
      may be dropped at the firewall(s), preventing MN(s) from updating\
      their binding cache and performing Route Optimization, since\
      Binding Update, HoT, and other MIPv6 signaling must be protected\
      by IPsec ESP.\
\
   Issue 2: If the firewall(s) protecting the home agent block\
      unsolicited incoming traffic (e.g., as stateful inspection packet\
      filters do), the firewall(s) may drop connection setup requests\
      from CNs, and packets from MNs.\
\
   Issue 3: If the home agent is in a network protected by several\
      firewalls, an MN/CN's change of IP address may result in the\
      passage of traffic to and from the home agent through a different\
      firewall that may not have the states corresponding to the flows.\
      As a consequence, packets may be dropped at the firewall.\
\
5.4.  Scenario Where the MN Moves to a Network Protected by Firewall(s)\
\
   Let's consider an HA in a network protected by firewall(s).  The\
   following issues need to be investigated:\
\
   Issue 1: Similarly to issue 1 described in Section 5.1, the MN will\
      send a Binding Update to its home agent after acquiring a local IP\
      address (CoA).  The Binding Updates and Acknowledgements should be\
      protected by IPsec ESP according to the MIPv6 specifications [1].\
      However, as a default rule, many firewalls drop ESP packets.  This\
      may cause the Binding Updates and Acknowledgements between the\
      mobile nodes and their home agent to be dropped.\

RFC 4487                  MIPv6 and Firewalls                   May 2006\
\
\
   Issue 2: The MN may be in a communication with a CN, or a CN may be\
      attempting to establish a connection with the MN.  In both cases,\
      packets sent from the CN will be forwarded by the MN's HA to the\
      MN's CoA.  However, when the packets arrive at the firewall(s),\
      the incoming traffic may not match any existing state, and the\
      firewall(s) may therefore drop it.\
\
   Issue 3: If the MN is in a communication with a CN, the MN may\
      attempt to execute an RRT for packets to be route optimized.\
      Similarly to issue 3, Section 5.1, the Home Test message that\
      should be protected by ESP may be dropped by firewall(s)\
      protecting the MN.  Firewall(s) may as a default rule drop any ESP\
      traffic.  As a consequence, the RRT cannot be completed.\
\
   Issue 4: If the MN is in a communication with a CN, and assuming that\
      the MN successfully sent a Binding Update to its CN to use Route\
      Optimization, packets will then be sent from the CN to the MN's\
      CoA and from the MN's CoA to the CN.\
\
      Packets sent from the CN to the MN's CoA may, however, not match\
      any existing entry in the firewall(s) protecting the MN, and\
      therefore be dropped by the firewall(s).\
\
      If packet filtering is applied to uplink traffic (i.e., traffic\
      sent by the MN), packets sent from the MN's CoA to the CN may not\
      match any entry in the firewall(s) either and may be dropped as\
      well.\
\
6.  Conclusions\
\
   Current firewalls may not only prevent route optimization but may\
   also prevent regular TCP and UDP sessions from being established in\
   some cases.  This document describes some of the issues between the\
   Mobile IPv6 protocol and current firewall technologies.\
\
   This document captures the various issues involved in the deployment\
   of Mobile IPv6 in networks that would invariably include firewalls.\
   A number of different scenarios are described, which include\
   configurations where the mobile node, correspondent node, and home\
   agent exist across various boundaries delimited by the firewalls.\
   This enables a better understanding of the issues when deploying\
   Mobile IPv6 as well as the issues for firewall design and policies to\
   be installed therein.\

7.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document describes several issues that exist between the Mobile\
   IPv6 protocol and firewalls.\
\
   Firewalls may prevent Mobile IP6 signaling in addition to dropping\
   incoming/outgoing traffic.\
\
   If the firewall configuration is modified in order to support the\
   Mobile IPv6 protocol but not properly configured, many attacks may be\
   possible as outlined above: malicious nodes may be able to launch\
   different types of denial of service attacks.\

Appendix A.  Applicability to 3G Networks\
\
   In 3G networks, different packet filtering functionalities may be\
   implemented to prevent malicious nodes from flooding or launching\
   other attacks against the 3G subscribers.  The packet filtering\
   functionality of 3G networks is further described in [4].  Packet\
   filters are set up and applied to both uplink and downlink traffic:\
   outgoing and incoming data not matching the packet filters is\
   dropped.  The issues described in this document also apply to 3G\
   networks.\

Abstract\
\
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined in\
   RFC 3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event\
   subscription used to notify the party sending a REFER request about\
   the receiver's status in executing the transaction requested by the\
   REFER.  These notifications are not needed in all cases.  This\
   specification provides a way to prevent the automatic establishment\
   of an event subscription and subsequent notifications using a new SIP\
   extension header field that may be included in a REFER request.\

RFC 4488             SIP REFER without Subscription             May 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The REFER specification [3] specifies that every REFER creates an\
   implicit subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the REFER-\
   Recipient.\
\
   This document defines a new SIP header field: "Refer-Sub" meaningful\
   within a REFER transaction only.  This header field, when set to\
   "false", specifies that a REFER-Issuer requests that the REFER-\
   Recipient doesn't establish an implicit subscription and the\
   resultant dialog.\
\
   This document defines a new option tag: "norefersub".  This tag, when\
   included in the Supported header field, indicates that a User Agent\
   (UA) is capable of accepting a REFER request without creating an\
   implicit subscription when acting as a REFER-Recipient.\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\
\
   To simplify discussions of the REFER method and its extensions, the\
   three terms below are being used throughout the document:\
\
   o  REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing the REFER request\
\
   o  REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request\
\
   o  REFER-Target: the UA designated in the Refer-To Uniform Resource\
      Identifier (URI)\
\
3.  Motivation\
\
   The REFER specification mandates that every REFER creates an implicit\
   subscription between the REFER-Issuer and the REFER-Recipient.  This\
   subscription results in at least one NOTIFY being sent from the\
   REFER-Recipient to the REFER-Issuer.  The REFER-Recipient may choose\
   to cancel the implicit subscription with this NOTIFY.  The REFER-\
   Issuer may choose to cancel this implicit subscription with an\
   explicit SUBSCRIBE (Expires: 0) after receipt of the initial NOTIFY.\
\
   One purpose of requiring the implicit subscription and initial NOTIFY\
   is to allow for the situation where the REFER request gets forked and\
   the REFER-Issuer needs a way to see the multiple dialogs that may be\
   established as a result of the forked REFER.  This is the same\
   approach used to handle forking of SUBSCRIBE [4] requests.  Where the\

RFC 4488             SIP REFER without Subscription             May 2006\
\
\
   REFER-Issuer explicitly specifies that forking not occur, the\
   requirement that an implicit subscription be established is\
   unnecessary.\
\
   Another purpose of the NOTIFY is to inform the REFER-Issuer of the\
   progress of the SIP transaction that results from the REFER at the\
   REFER-Recipient.  In the case where the REFER-Issuer is already aware\
   of the progress of the requested operation, such as when the REFER-\
   Issuer has an explicit subscription to the dialog event package at\
   the REFER-Recipient, the implicit subscription and resultant NOTIFY\
   traffic related to the REFER can create an unnecessary network\
   overhead.\
\
4.  Definitions\
\
   This document defines a new SIP header field: "Refer-Sub".  This\
   header field is meaningful and MAY be used with a REFER request and\
   the corresponding 2XX response only.  This header field set to\
   "false" specifies that a REFER-Issuer requests that the REFER-\
   Recipient doesn't establish an implicit subscription and the\
   resultant dialog.  Note that when using this extension, the REFER\
   remains a target refresh request (as in the default case -- when the\
   extension is not used).\
\
   This document adds the following entry to Table 2 of [2].  The\
   additions to this table are also provided for extension methods at\
   the time of publication of this document.  This is provided as a\
   courtesy to the reader and is not normative in any way:\
\
   Header field        where    proxy ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG  MSG\
\
   Refer-Sub           R, 2xx          -    -    -    -    -    -    -\
\
   Header field        where    SUB  NOT  REF  INF  UPD  PRA  PUB\
\
   Refer-Sub           R, 2xx    -    -    o    -    -    -    -\
\
\
   The Refer-Sub header field MAY be encrypted as part of end-to-end\
   encryption.\
\
   The syntax of the header field follows the BNF defined below:\
\
    Refer-Sub       = "Refer-Sub" HCOLON refer-sub-value *(SEMI exten)\
    refer-sub-value = "true" / "false"\
    exten           = generic-param\
\
   where the syntax of generic-param is defined in [2].\

RFC 4488             SIP REFER without Subscription             May 2006\
\
\
   The "Refer-Sub" header field set to "false" MAY be used by the REFER-\
   Issuer only when the REFER-Issuer can be certain that the REFER\
   request will not be forked.\
\
   If the REFER-Recipient supports the extension and is willing to\
   process the REFER transaction without establishing an implicit\
   subscription, it MUST insert the "Refer-Sub" header field set to\
   "false" in the 2xx response to the REFER-Issuer.  In this case, no\
   implicit subscription is created.  Consequently, no new dialog is\
   created if this REFER was issued outside any existing dialog.\
\
   If the REFER-Issuer inserts the "Refer-Sub" header field set to\
   "false", but the REFER-Recipient doesn't grant the suggestion (i.e.,\
   either does not include the "Refer-Sub" header field or includes the\
   "Refer-Sub" header field set to "true" in the 2xx response), an\
   implicit subscription is created as in the default case.\
\
   This document also defines a new option tag, "norefersub".  This tag,\
   when included in the Supported header field, specifies that a User\
   Agent (UA) is capable of accepting a REFER request without creating\
   an implicit subscription when acting as a REFER-Recipient.\
\
   The REFER-Issuer can know the capabilities of the REFER-Recipient\
   from the presence of the option tags in the Supported header field of\
   the dialog initiating request or response.  Another way of learning\
   the capabilities would be by using presence, such as defined in [6].\
   However, if the capabilities of the REFER-Recipient are not known,\
   using the "norefersub" tag with the Require header field is NOT\
   RECOMMENDED.  This is due to the fact that in the event the REFER-\
   Recipient doesn't support the extension, in order to fall back to the\
   normal REFER, the REFER-Issuer will need to issue a new REFER\
   transaction thus resulting in additional round-trips.\
\
   As described in Section 8.2.2.3 in [2], a REFER-Recipient will reject\
   a REFER request containing a Require: norefersub header field with a\
   420 (Bad Extension) response unless it supports this extension.  Note\
   that Require: norefersub can be present with a Refer-Sub: false\
   header field.\
\
5.  Preventing Forking of REFER Requests\
\
   The REFER specification allows for the possibility of forking a REFER\
   request that is sent outside of an existing dialog.  In addition, a\
   proxy may fork an unknown method type.  Should forking occur, the\
   sender of the REFER with "Refer-Sub" will not be aware as only a\
   single 2xx response will be forwarded by the forking proxy.  As a\
   result, the responsibility is on the issuer of the REFER with "Refer-\
   Sub" to ensure that no forking will result.\

RFC 4488             SIP REFER without Subscription             May 2006\
\
\
   If a REFER request to a given Request-URI might fork, the REFER-\
   Issuer SHOULD NOT include the "Refer-Sub" header field.  The REFER-\
   Issuer SHOULD use standardized mechanisms for ensuring the REFER\
   request does not fork.  In absence of any other mechanism, the\
   Request-URI of the REFER request SHOULD have Globally Routable User\
   Agent URI (GRUU) properties according to the definitions of [5] as\
   those properties ensure the request will not fork.\

   This document registers a new SIP header field "Refer-Sub".  This\
   header field is only meaningful for the REFER request defined in RFC\
   3515 [3] and the corresponding response.  The following information\
   has been added to the SIP Header field sub-registry in the SIP\
   Parameters Registry:\
\
   o  Header Name: Refer-Sub\
\
   o  Compact Form: None\
\
   o  Reference: RFC 4488\
\
   This document also registers a new SIP option tag, "norefersub",\
   adding it to the SIP Option Tags sub-registry in the SIP Parameters\
   Registry.  The required information for this registration, as\
   specified in RFC 3261 [2], is:\

RFC 4488             SIP REFER without Subscription             May 2006\
\
\
   o  Name: norefersub\
\
   o  Description: This option tag specifies a User Agent ability of\
      accepting a REFER request without establishing an implicit\
      subscription (compared to the default case defined in RFC 3515\
      [3]).\
\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   The purpose of this SIP extension is to modify the expected behavior\
   of the REFER-Recipient.  The change in behavior is for the REFER-\
   Recipient not to establish a dialog and not to send NOTIFY messages\
   back to the REFER-Issuer.  As such, a malicious inclusion of a\
   "Refer-Sub" header field set to "false" reduces the processing and\
   state requirements on the recipient.  As a result, its use in a\
   denial-of-service attack seems limited.\
\
   On the other hand, by inserting a "Refer-Sub" header field set to\
   "false", a man-in-the-middle (MitM) can potentially exploit the\
   mechanism for easier (than an interception) suppression of the\
   notifications from the REFER-Receiver without the REFER-Issuer\
   noticing it.  Also, by removing a "Refer-Sub" header field set to\
   "false", a MitM can cause the REFER-Receiver to generate\
   notifications over the implicit dialog that otherwise had been\
   suppressed by the REFER-Issuer.\
\
   To protect against these kinds of MitM attacks, integrity protection\
   should be used.  For example, the REFER-Issuer could use S/MIME as\
   discussed in RFC 3261 [2] to protect against these kinds of attacks.\

\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has\
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code\
   (CMAC).  CMAC [NIST-CMAC] is a message authentication code that is\
   based on a symmetric key block cipher such as the Advanced Encryption\
   Standard [NIST-AES].  CMAC is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1\
   (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa [OMAC1a, OMAC1b].  OMAC1 is\
   an improvement of the eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC)\
   submitted by Black and Rogaway [XCBCa, XCBCb], which itself is an\
   improvement of the basic CBC-MAC.  XCBC efficiently addresses the\
   security deficiencies of CBC-MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently reduces the\
   key size of XCBC.\
\
   This memo specifies the usage of CMAC on the authentication mechanism\
   of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload [ESP] and Authentication\
   Header [AH] protocols.  This new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96.  For\
   further information on AH and ESP, refer to [AH] and [ROADMAP].\

                   bits of the 128-bit output.\
\
3.  AES-CMAC\
\
   The core of AES-CMAC-96 is the AES-CMAC [AES-CMAC].  The underlying\
   algorithms for AES-CMAC are the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher\
   block [NIST-AES] and the recently defined CMAC mode of operation\
   [NIST-CMAC].  AES-CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity\
   than a checksum or an error detecting code.  The verification of a\
   checksum or an error detecting code detects only accidental\
   modifications of the data, while CMAC is designed to detect\
   intentional, unauthorized modifications of the data, as well as\
   accidental modifications.  The output of AES-CMAC can validate the\
   input message.  Validating the message provides assurance of the\
   integrity and authenticity over the message from the source.\
   According to [NIST-CMAC], at least 64 bits should be used against\
   guessing attacks.  AES-CMAC achieves the similar security goal of\
   HMAC [RFC-HMAC].  Since AES-CMAC is based on a symmetric key block\
   cipher (AES), while HMAC is based on a hash function (such as SHA-1),\
   AES-CMAC is appropriate for information systems in which AES is more\
   readily available than a hash function.  Detailed information about\
   AES-CMAC is available in [AES-CMAC] and [NIST-CMAC].\

\
4.  AES-CMAC-96\
\
   For IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, AES-CMAC-96 should be\
   used.  AES-CMAC-96 is a AES-CMAC with 96-bit truncated output in\
   MSB-first order.  The output is a 96-bit MAC that will meet the\
   default authenticator length as specified in [AH].  The result of\
   truncation is taken in MSB-first order.  For further information on\
   AES-CMAC, refer to [AES-CMAC] and [NIST-CMAC].\
\
   Figure 1 describes AES-CMAC-96 algorithm:\
\
   In step 1, AES-CMAC is applied to the message M in length len with\
   key K.\
\
   In step 2, the output block T is truncated to 12 octets in MSB-first\
   order, and Truncated T (TT) is returned.\

Abstract\
\
   This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing\
   architecture of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows the use of\
   Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.  When a\
   link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of a node,\
   an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node can generate\
   its unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  The\
   alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses\
   proposed in this document is better than known methods like unicast-\
   prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses.  This memo updates RFC 3306.\

RFC 4489               Link-Scoped IPv6 Multicast             April 2006\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document defines an extension to the multicast portion of the\
   IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291].  The current architecture\
   does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address allocation.\
   The extension allows for use of IIDs to allocate multicast addresses.\
   When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of\
   a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node can\
   generate its unique multicast addresses automatically without\
   conflicts.  That is, these addresses could safely be configured at\
   any time after Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) has completed.\
\
   This method for the link-local scope is preferred over unicast-\
   prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses [RFC3306], since by delegating\
   multicast addresses using the IID, each node can generate its\
   multicast addresses automatically without allocation servers.  This\
   method works better than the unicast-prefix-based method with\
   applications in serverless environments such as ad-hoc and network\
   mobility.  This document restricts the usage of defined fields such\
   as the scop, plen, and network prefix fields of [RFC3306].\
   Therefore, this document specifies encoded information for link-local\
   scope in multicast addresses.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this\
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
\
2.  Applicability\
\
   The allocation technique in this document is designed to be used in\
   any environment in which link-local scope IPv6 multicast addresses\
   are assigned or selected.  This method goes especially well with\
   nodes supplying multicast services in a zeroconf/serverless\
   environment.  For example, multicast addresses less than or equal to\
   link-local scope are themselves generated by nodes supplying\
   multicast services without conflicts.  Also, hosts that are supplied\
   multicast services from multicast servers then make multicast\
   addresses of multicast servers using ND (address resolution) and\
   well-known group IDs [RFC2461].\
\
   Consequently, this technique MUST only be used for link scoped\
   multicast addresses.  If you want to use multicast addresses greater\
   than link-local scope, you need to use other methods as described in\
   [RFC3306].\

\
\
3.  Link-Scoped Multicast Address Format\
\
   This document specifies a new format that incorporates IID in the\
   link-local scope multicast addresses.\
\
   Figure 1 illustrates the new format for link-scoped multicast\
   addresses.\
\
      |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |\
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\
      |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  |       IID      | group ID |\
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\
\
           Figure 1.  Link-Scoped Multicast IPv6 Address Format\
\
   The flgs, scop, and plen fields are used to identify whether an\
   address is a multicast address, as follows:\
\
    1. flgs MUST be "0011".\
\
    2. scop MUST be <= 2.\
\
    3. The reserved field MUST be zero.\
\
    4. The "plen" field is a special value, "1111 1111" (decimal 255).\
\
   The IID field (replacing the 64-bit prefix field from [RFC3306]) is\
   used to distinguish each node from others.  Given the use of this\
   method for link-local scope, the IID embedded in the multicast\
   address MUST only come from the IID of the link-local unicast address\
   on the interface after DAD has completed.  That is, the creation of\
   the multicast address MUST only occur after DAD has completed as part\
   of the auto-configuration process.\
\
   Group ID is generated to indicate a multicast application and is used\
   to guarantee its uniqueness only in the host.  It may also be set on\
   the basis of the guidelines outlined in [RFC3307].\
\
4.  Example\
\
   In an Ethernet environment, if the link-local unicast address is\
   FE80::A12:34FF:FE56:7890, the link-scoped multicast prefix of the\
   node is FF32:00FF:A12:34FF:FE56:7890::/96.\
\

\
\
5.  Consideration of Lifetime\
\
   Generally, link-scoped multicast addresses have no lifetime, because\
   link-local unicast addresses also have no lifetime.  However, this is\
   not true in the mobile environment.  Even though multicast addresses\
   are created from the unique IIDs of unicast addresses, their useful\
   lifetime is linked to the period during which the IID is known to be\
   unique.  Thus, conflict is possible between IIDs, due to a new node\
   in merged network that uses the same IID as a powered node.\
\
   In this scenario, DAD also fails to guarantee uniqueness of the\
   unicast address, but this document does not try to address this\
   issue.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   The uniqueness of multicast addresses using this method is guaranteed\
   by the DAD process.  So, a secure DAD process is needed for stability\
   of this method.  This document proposes the mechanism in [RFC3041]\
   for this purpose.\
\
   [RFC3041] describes the privacy extension to IPv6 stateless address\
   autoconfiguration to configure the IID of non-link-local scope\
   unicast addresses.  [RFC3041] cannot be used for making a link-local\
   unicast address, and hence it cannot be used to create an IID for\
   link-scoped multicast address.  However, as [RFC3041] does not\
   protect the privacy of link-local unicast addresses, it does not seem\
   to be required to protect the privacy of IID-based link-local\
   multicast addresses.\
\
7.  Acknowledgements\
\
   We would like to thank Dave Thaler and Brian Haberman for their\
   comments related to the consistency between the unicast prefix-based\
   multicast document and this one.  Special thanks are due to Erik\
   Nordmark and Pekka Savola for valuable comments.\
