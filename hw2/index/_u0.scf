Abstract\
\
   This document proposes an extension to the Resource Reservation\
   Protocol (RSVPv1) to reduce the guaranteed bandwidth allocated to an\
   existing reservation.  This mechanism can be used to affect\
   individual reservations, aggregate reservations, or other forms of\
   RSVP tunnels.  This specification is an extension of RFC 2205.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document proposes an extension to the Resource Reservation\
   Protocol (RSVP) [1] to allow an existing reservation to be reduced in\
   allocated bandwidth in lieu of tearing that reservation down when\
   some of that reservation's bandwidth is needed for other purposes.\
   Several examples exist in which this mechanism may be utilized.\
\
   The bandwidth allotted to an individual reservation may be reduced\
   due to a variety of reasons such as preemption, etc.  In such cases,\
   when the entire bandwidth allocated to a reservation is not required,\
   the reservation need not be torn down.  The solution described in\
   this document allows endpoints to negotiate a new (lower) bandwidth\
   that falls at or below the specified new bandwidth maximum allocated\
   by the network.  Using a voice session as an example, this indication\
   in RSVP could lead endpoints, using another protocol such as Session\
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [9], to signal for a lower-bandwidth codec\
   and retain the reservation.\
\
   With RSVP aggregation [2], two aggregate flows with differing\
   priority levels may traverse the same router interface.  If that\
   router interface reaches bandwidth capacity and is then asked to\
   establish a new reservation or increase an existing reservation, the\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   router has to make a choice: deny the new request (because all\
   resources have been utilized) or preempt an existing lower-priority\
   reservation to make room for the new or expanded reservation.\
\
   If the flow being preempted is an aggregate of many individual flows,\
   this has greater consequences.  While [2] clearly does not terminate\
   all the individual flows if an aggregate is torn down, this event\
   will cause packets to be discarded during aggregate reservation\
   reestablishment.  This document describes a method where only the\
   minimum required bandwidth is taken away from the lower-priority\
   aggregated reservation and the entire reservation is not preempted.\
   This has the advantage that only some of the microflows making up the\
   aggregate are affected.  Without this extension, all individual flows\
   are affected and the deaggregator will have to attempt the\
   reservation request with a reduced bandwidth.\
\
   RSVP tunnels utilizing IPsec [8] also require an indication that the\
   reservation must be reduced to a certain amount (or less).  RSVP\
   aggregation with IPsec tunnels is being defined in [11], which should\
   be able to take advantage of the mechanism created here in this\
   specification.\
\
   Note that when this document refers to a router interface being\
   "full" or "at capacity", this does not imply that all of the\
   bandwidth has been used, but rather that all of the bandwidth\
   available for reservation(s) via RSVP under the applicable policy has\
   been used.  Policies for real-time traffic routinely reserve capacity\
   for routing and inelastic applications, and may distinguish between\
   voice, video, and other real-time applications.\
\
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [10] is an indication that the\
   transmitting endpoint must reduce its transmission.  It does not\
   provide sufficient indication to tell the endpoint by how much the\
   reduction should be.  Hence the application may have to attempt\
   multiple times before it is able to drop its bandwidth utilization\
   below the available limit.  Therefore, while we consider ECN to be\
   very useful for elastic applications, it is not sufficient for the\
   purpose of inelastic application where an indication of bandwidth\
   availability is useful for codec selection.\
\
   Section 2 discusses the individual reservation flow problem, while\
   Section 3 discusses the aggregate reservation flow problem space.\
   Section 4 lists the requirements for this extension.  Section 5\
   details the protocol changes necessary in RSVP to create a\
   reservation reduction indication.  And finally, the appendix provides\
   a walk-through example of how this extension modifies RSVP\
   functionality in an aggregate scenario.\

2.  Individual Reservation Reduction Scenario\
\
   Figure 1 is a network topology that is used to describe the benefit\
   of bandwidth reduction in an individual reservation.\

\
                   Figure 1.  Simple Reservation Flows\
\
         Legend/Rules:\
\
         - Flow 1 priority = 300\
         - Flow 2 priority = 100\
         - Both flows are shown in the same direction (left to\
           right).  Corresponding flows in the reverse direction are\
           not shown for diagram simplicity\
\
   RSVP is a reservation establishment protocol in one direction only.\
   This split-path philosophy is because the routed path from one device\
   to the other in one direction might not be the routed path for\
   communicating between the same two endpoints in the reverse\
   direction.  End-systems must request 2 one-way reservations if that\
   is what is needed for a particular application (like voice calls).\
   Please refer to [1] for the details on how this functions.  This\
   example only describes the reservation scenario in one direction for\
   simplicity's sake.\
\
   Figure 1 depicts 2 routers (R1 and R2) initially with only one flow\
   (Flow 1).  The flows are forwarded from R1 to R2 via Int 2.  For this\
   example, let us say that Flow 1 and Flow 2 each require 80 units of\
   bandwidth (such as for the codec G.711 with no silence suppression).\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Let us also say that the RSVP bandwidth limit for Int 2 of R1 is 100\
   units.\
\
   As described in [3], a priority indication is established for each\
   flow.  In fact, there are two priority indications:\
\
      1) one to establish the reservation, and\
\
      2) one to defend the reservation.\
\
   In this example, Flow 1 and Flow 2 have an 'establishing' and a\
   'defending' priority of 300 and 100, respectively.  Flow 2 will have\
   a higher establishing priority than Flow 1 has for its defending\
   priority.  This means that when Flow 2 is signaled, and if no\
   bandwidth is available at the interface, Flow 1 will have to\
   relinquish bandwidth in favor of the higher-priority request of Flow\
   2.  The priorities assigned to a reservation are always end-to-end,\
   and not altered by any routers in transit.\
\
   Without the benefit of this specification, Flow 1 will be preempted.\
   This specification makes it possible for the ResvErr message to\
   indicate that 20 units are still available for a reservation to\
   remain up (the interface's 100 units maximum minus Flow 2's 80\
   units).  The reservation initiating node (router or end-system) for\
   Flow 1 has the opportunity to renegotiate (via call signaling) for\
   acceptable parameters within the existing and available bandwidth for\
   the flow (for example, it may decide to change to using a codec such\
   as G.729)\
\
   The problems avoided with the partial failure of the flow are:\
\
   - Reduced packet loss, which results as Flow 1 attempts to\
     reestablish the reservation for a lower bandwidth.\
\
   - Inefficiency caused by multiple attempts until Flow 1 is able to\
     request bandwidth equal to or lower than what is available.  If\
     Flow 1 is established with much less than what is available then it\
     leads to inefficient use of available bandwidth.\

3.  RSVP Aggregation Overview\
\
   The following network overview is to help visualize the concerns that\
   this specification addresses in RSVP aggregates.  Figure 2 consists\
   of 10 routers (the boxes) and 11 flows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, A, B, C, D,\
   and E).  Initially, there will be 5 flows per aggregate (Flow 9 will\
   be introduced to cause the problem we are addressing in this\
   document), with 2 aggregates (X and Y); Flows 1 through 5 in\
   aggregate X and Flows A through E in aggregate Y.  These 2 aggregates\
   will cross one router interface utilizing all available capacity (in\
   this example).\
\
   RSVP aggregation (per [2]) is no different from an individual\
   reservation with respect to being unidirectional.\

\
\
      The path for aggregate X is:\
\
         R1 => R2 => R10 => R11 => R3 => R4\
\
      where aggregate X starts in R1, and deaggregates in R4.\
\
      Flows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 communicate through aggregate A.\
\
      The path for aggregate Y is:\
\
         R5 ::> R6 ::> R10 ::> R11 ::> R7 ::> R8\
\
      where aggregate Y starts in R5, and deaggregates in R8.\
\
      Flows A, B, C, D, and E communicate through aggregate B.\
\
   Both aggregates share one leg or physical link: between R10 and R11,\
   thus they share one outbound interface: Int 8 of R10, where\
   contention of resources may exist.  That link has an RSVP capacity of\
   800 kbps.  RSVP signaling (messages) is outside the 800 kbps in this\
   example, as is any session signaling protocol like SIP.\
\
3.1.  RSVP Aggregation Reduction Scenario\
\
   Figure 2 shows an established aggregated reservation (aggregate X)\
   between the routers R1 and R4.  This aggregated reservation consists\
   of 5 microflows (Flows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).  For the sake of this\
   discussion, let us assume that each flow represents a voice call and\
   requires 80 kb (such as for the codec G.711 with no silence\
   suppression).  Aggregate X request is for 400 kbps (80 kbps * 5\
   flows).  The priority of the aggregate is derived from the individual\
   microflows that it is made up of.  In the simple case, all flows of a\
   single priority are bundled as a single aggregate (another priority\
   level would be in another aggregate, even if traversing the same path\
   through the network).  There may be other ways in which the priority\
   of the aggregate is derived, but for this discussion it is sufficient\
   to note that each aggregate contains a priority (both hold and\
   defending priority).  The means of deriving the priority is out of\
   scope for this discussion.\
\
   Aggregate Y, in Figure 2, consists of Flows A, B, C, D, and E and\
   requires 400 kbps (80 kbps * 5 flows), and starts at R5 and ends R8.\
   This means there are two aggregates occupying all 800 kbps of the\
   RSVP capacity.\
\
   When Flow 9 is added into aggregate X, this will occupy 80 kbps more\
   than Int 8 on R10 has available (880k offered load vs. 800k capacity)\
   [1] and [2] create a behavior in RSVP to deny the entire aggregate Y\

\
\
   and all its individual flows because aggregate X has a higher\
   priority.  This situation is where this document focuses its\
   requirements and calls for a solution.  There should be some means to\
   signal to all affected routers of aggregate Y that only 80 kbps is\
   needed to accommodate another (higher priority) aggregate.  A\
   solution that accomplishes this reduction instead of a failure could:\
\
      - reduce significant packet loss of all flows within aggregate Y\
\
   During the re-reservation request period of time no packets will\
   traverse the aggregate until it is reestablished.\
\
      - reduces the chances that the reestablishment of the aggregate\
        will reserve an inefficient amount of bandwidth, causing the\
        likely preemption of more individual flows at the aggregator\
        than would be necessary had the aggregator had more information\
        (that RSVP does not provide at this time)\
\
   During reestablishment of the aggregation in Figure 2 (without any\
   modification to RSVP), R8 would guess at how much bandwidth to ask\
   for in the new RESV message.  It could request too much bandwidth,\
   and have to wait for the error that not that much bandwidth was\
   available; it could request too little bandwidth and have that\
   aggregation accepted, but this would mean that more individual flows\
   would need to be preempted outside the aggregate than were necessary,\
   leading to inefficiencies in the opposite direction.\
\
4.  Requirements for Reservation Reduction\
\
   The following are the requirements to reduce the bandwidth of a\
   reservation.  This applies to both individual and aggregate\
   reservations:\
\
   Req#1 - MUST have the ability to differentiate one reservation from\
           another.  In the case of aggregates, it MUST distinguish one\
           aggregate from other flows.\
\
   Req#2 - MUST have the ability to indicate within an RSVP error\
           message (generated at the router with the congested\
           interface) that a specific reservation (individual or\
           aggregate) is to be reduced in bandwidth.\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Req#4 - MUST NOT produce a case in which retransmitted reduction\
           indications further reduce the bandwidth of a reservation.\
           Any additional reduction in bandwidth for a specified\
           reservation MUST be signaled in a new message.\
\
   RSVP messages are unreliable and can get lost.  This specification\
   should not compound any error in the network.  If a reduction message\
   were lost, another one needs to be sent.  If the receiver ends up\
   receiving two copies to reduce the bandwidth of a reservation by some\
   amount, it is likely the router will reduce the bandwidth by twice\
   the amount that was actually called for.  This will be in error.\
\
5.  RSVP Bandwidth Reduction Solution\
\
   When a reservation is partially failed, a ResvErr (Reservation Error)\
   message is generated just as it is done currently with preemptions.\
   The ERROR_SPEC object and the PREEMPTION_PRI object are included as\
   well.  Very few additions/changes are needed to the ResvErr message\
   to support partial preemptions.  A new error subcode is required and\
   is defined in Section 5.1.  The ERROR_SPEC object contained in the\
   ResvErr message indicates the flowspec that is reserved.  The\
   bandwidth indication in this flowspec SHOULD be less than the\
   original reservation request.  This is defined in Section 5.2.\
\
   A comment about RESV messages that do not use reliable transport:\
   This document RECOMMENDS that ResvErr messages be made reliable by\
   implementing mechanisms in [6].\
\
   The current behavior in RSVP requires a ResvTear message to be\
   transmitted upstream when the ResvErr message is transmitted\
   downstream (per [1]).  This ResvTear message terminates the\
   reservation in all routers upstream of the router where the failure\
   occurred.  This document requires that the ResvTear is only generated\
   when the reservation is to be completely removed.  In cases where the\
   reservation is only to be reduced, routers compliant with this\
   specification require that the ResvTear message MUST NOT be sent.\
\
   The appendix has been written to walk through the overall solution to\
   the problems presented in Sections 2 and 3.  There is mention of this\
   ResvTear transmission behavior in the appendix.\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
5.1.  Partial Preemption Error Code\
\
   The ResvErr message generated due to preemption includes the\
   ERROR_SPEC object as well as the PREEMPTION_PRI object.  The format\
   of ERROR_SPEC objects is defined in [1].  The error code listed in\
   the ERROR_SPEC object for preemption [5] currently is as follows:\
\
         Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and\
         ErrSubCode = 5 (ERR_PREEMPT)\
\
   The following error code is suggested in the ERROR_SPEC object for\
   partial preemption:\
\
      Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and\
      ErrSubCode = 102 (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)\
\
   There is also an error code in the PREEMPTION-PRI object.  This error\
   code takes a value of 1 to indicate that the admitted flow was\
   preempted [3].  The same error value of 1 may be used for the partial\
   preemption case as well.\
\
5.2.  Error Flow Descriptor\
\
   The error flow descriptor is defined in [1] and [7].  In the case of\
   partial failure, the flowspec contained in the error flow descriptor\
   indicates the highest average and peak rates that the preempting\
   system can accept in the next RESV message.  The deaggregator must\
   reduce its reservation to a number less than or equal to that,\
   whether by changing codecs, dropping reservations, or some other\
   mechanism.\
\
5.3.  Individual Reservation Flow Reduction\
\
   When a router requires part of the bandwidth that has been allocated\
   to a reservation be used for another flow, the router engages in the\
   partial reduction of bandwidth as described in this document.  The\
   router sends a ResvErr downstream to indicate the partial error with\
   the error code and subcode as described in section 5.1.  The flowspec\
   contained in the ResvErr message will be used to indicate the\
   bandwidth that is currently allocated.\
\
   The requesting endpoint that receives the ResvErr can then negotiate\
   with the transmitting endpoint to lower the bandwidth requirement (by\
   selecting another lower bandwidth codec, for example).  After the\
   negotiations, both endpoints will issue the RSVP PATH and RESV\
   message with the new, lowered bandwidth.\

\
\
5.4.  Aggregation Reduction of Individual Flows\
\
   When a partial failure occurs in an aggregation scenario, the\
   deaggregator receives the ResvErr message with the reduction\
   indication from a router in the path of the aggregate.  It then\
   decides whether one or more individual flows from the aggregate are\
   to be affected by this ResvErr message.  The following choices are\
   possible:\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that one or more\
      individual flow(s) are to partially failed, then it sends a\
      ResvErr message with a reduced bandwidth indication to those\
      individual flow(s).  This is as per the descriptions in the\
      previous section (5.3).\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that one individual flow\
      is to be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it determines\
      which flow is affected.  That router transmits a new ResvErr\
      message downstream per [3].  That same router transmits a ResvTear\
      message upstream.  This ResvTear message of an individual flow\
      does not tear down the aggregate.  Only the individual flow is\
      affected.\
\
   o  If that (deaggregator) router determines that multiple individual\
      flows are to be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it\
      chooses which flows are affected.  That router transmits a new\
      ResvErr message downstream as per [3] to each individual flow.\
      The router also transmits ResvTear messages upstream for the same\
      individual flows.  These ResvTear messages of an individual flow\
      do not tear down the aggregate.  Only the individual flows are\
      affected.\
\
   In all cases, the deaggregator lowers the bandwidth requested in the\
   Aggregate Resv message to reflect the change.\
\
   Which particular flow or series of flows within an aggregate are\
   picked by the deaggregator for bandwidth reduction or preemption is\
   outside the scope of this document.\
\
5.5.  RSVP Flow Reduction Involving IPsec Tunnels\
\
   RFC 2207 (per [8]) specifies how RSVP reservations function in IPsec\
   data flows.  The nodes initiating the IPsec flow can be an end-system\
   like a computer, or it can router between two end-systems, or it can\
   be an in-line bulk encryption device immediately adjacent to a router\
   interface; [11] directly addresses this later scenario.\
\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   The methods of identification of an IPsec with reservation flow are\
   different from non-encrypted flows, but how the reduction mechanism\
   specified within this document functions is not.\
\
   An IPsec with reservation flow is, for all intents and purposes,\
   considered an individual flow with regard to how to reduce the\
   bandwidth of the flow.  Obviously, an IPsec with reservation flow can\
   be a series of individual flows or disjointed best-effort packets\
   between two systems.  But to this specification, this tunnel is an\
   individual RSVP reservation.\
\
   Anywhere within this specification that mentions an individual\
   reservation flow, the same rules of bandwidth reduction and\
   preemption MUST apply.\
\
5.6.  Reduction of Multiple Flows at Once\
\
   As a cautionary note, bandwidth SHOULD NOT be reduced across multiple\
   reservations at the same time, in reaction to the same reduction\
   event.  A router not knowing the impact of reservation bandwidth\
   reduction on more than one flow may cause more widespread ill effects\
   than is necessary.\
\
   This says nothing to a policy where preemption should or should not\
   occur across multiple flows.\
\
6.  Backwards Compatibility\
\
   Backwards compatibility with this extension will result in RSVP\
   operating as it does without this extension, and no worse.  The two\
   routers involved in this extension are the router that had the\
   congested interface and the furthest downstream router that\
   determines what to do with the reduction indication.\
\
   In the case of the router that experiences congestion or otherwise\
   needs to reduce the bandwidth of an existing reservation:\
\
   - If that router supports this extension:\
\
     #1 - it generates the ResvErr message with the error code\
          indicating the reduction in bandwidth.\
\
     #2 - it does not generate the ResvTear message.\
\
   - If that router does not support this extension, it generates both\
     ResvErr and ResvTear messages according to [1].\
\

\
RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   In the case of the router at the extreme downstream of a reservation\
   that receives the ResvErr message with the reduction indication:\
\
   - If that router does support this extension:\
\
     #1 - it processes this error message and applies whatever local\
          policy it is configured to do to determine how to reduce the\
          bandwidth of this designated flow.\
\
   - If the router does not support this extension:\
\
     #1 - it processes the ResvErr message according to [1] and all\
          extensions it is able to understand, but not this extension\
          from this document.\
\
   Thus, this extension does not cause ill effects within RSVP if one or\
   more routers support this extension, and one or more routers do not\
   support this extension.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document does not lessen the overall security of RSVP or of\
   reservation flows through an aggregate.\
\
   If this specification is implemented poorly - which is never\
   intended, but is a consideration - the following issues may arise:\
\
   1) If the ResvTear messages are transmitted initially (at the same\
      time as the ResvErr messages indicating a reduction in bandwidth\
      is necessary), all upstream routers will tear down the entire\
      reservation.  This will free up the total amount of bandwidth of\
      this reservation inadvertently.  This may cause the re-\
      establishment of an otherwise good reservation to fail.  This has\
      the most severe affects on an aggregate that has many individual\
      flows that would have remained operational.\
\
   2) Just as RSVP has the vulnerability of premature termination of\
      valid reservations by rogue flows without authentication [12, 13],\
      this mechanism will have the same vulnerability.  Usage of RSVP\
      authentication mechanisms is encouraged.\

8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The IANA has assigned the following from RFC 4495 (i.e., this\
   document):\
\
   The following error code has been defined in the ERROR_SPEC object\
   for partial reservation failure under "Errcode = 2 (Policy Control\
   Failure)":\
\
      ErrSubCode = 102 (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)\
\
   The behavior of this ErrSubCode is defined in this document.\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   Looking at Figure 2, aggregate X (with five 80 kbps flows) traverses:\
\
         R1 ==> R2 ==> R10 ==> R11 ==> R3 ==> R4\
\
   And aggregate Y (with five 80 kbps flows) traverses:\
\
         R5 ::> R6 ::> R10 ::> R11 ::> R7 ::> R8\
\
   Both aggregates are 400 kbps.  This totals 800 kbps at Int 7 in R10,\
   which is the maximum bandwidth that RSVP has access to at this\
   interface.  Signaling messages still traverse the interface without\
   problem.  Aggregate X is at a higher relative priority than aggregate\
   Y.  Local policy in this example is for higher relative priority\
   flows to preempt lower-priority flows during times of congestion.\
   The following points describe the flow when aggregate A is increased\
   to include Flow 9.\
\
   o  When Flow 9 (at 80 kbps) is added to aggregate X, R1 will initiate\
      the PATH message towards the destination endpoint of the flow.\
      This hop-by-hop message will take it through R2, R10, R11, R3, and\
      R4, which is the aggregate X path (that was built per [2] from the\
      aggregate's initial setup) to the endpoint node.\
\
   o  In response, R4 will generate the RESV (reservation) message\
      (defined behavior per [1]).  This RESV from the deaggregator\
      indicates an increase bandwidth sufficient to accommodate the\
      existing 5 flows (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and the new flow (9), as\
      stated in [2].\
\
   o  As mentioned before, in this example, Int 8 in R10 can only\
      accommodate 800 kbps, and aggregates X and Y have each already\
      established 400 kbps flows comprised of five 80 kbps individual\
      flows.  Therefore, R10 (the interface that detects a congestion\
      event in this example) must make a decision about this new\
      congestion generating condition in regard to the RESV message\
      received at Int 8.\
\
   o  Local policy in this scenario is to preempt lower-priority\
      reservations to place higher-priority reservations.  This would\
      normally cause all of aggregate Y to be preempted just to\
      accommodate aggregate X's request for an additional 80 kbps.\
\
   o  This document defines how aggregate Y is not completely preempted,\
      but reduced in bandwidth by 80 kbps.  This is contained in the\
      ResvErr message that R10 generates (downstream) towards R11, R7,\
      and R8.  See section 5 for the details of the error message.\

RFC 4495                RSVP Bandwidth Reduction                May 2006\
\
\
   o  Normal operation of RSVP is to have the router that generates a\
      ResvErr message downstream to also generate a ResvTear message\
      upstream (in the opposite direction, i.e., towards R5).  The\
      ResvTear message terminates an individual flow or aggregate flow.\
      This document calls for that message not to be sent on any partial\
      failure of reservation.\
\
   o  R8 is the deaggregator of aggregate Y.  The deaggregator controls\
      all the parameters of an aggregate reservation.  This will be the\
      node that reduces the necessary bandwidth of the aggregate as a\
      response to the reception of an ResvErr message (from R10)\
      indicating such an action is called for.  In this example,\
      bandwidth reduction is accomplished by preempting an individual\
      flow within the aggregate (perhaps picking on Flow D for\
      individual preemption by generating a ResvErr downstream on that\
      individual flow).\
\
   o  At the same time, a ResvTear message is transmitted upstream on\
      that individual flow (Flow D) by R8.  This will not affect the\
      aggregate directly, but is an indication to the routers (and the\
      source end-system) which individual flow is to be preempted.\
\
   o  Once R8 preempts whichever individual flow (or 'bandwidth' at the\
      aggregate ingress), it transmits a new RESV message for that\
      aggregate (Y), not for a new aggregate.  This RESV from the\
      deaggregator indicates a decrease in bandwidth sufficient to\
      accommodate the remaining 4 flows (A, B, C, and E), which is now\
      320 kbps (in this example).\
\
   o  This RESV message travels the entire path of the reservation,\
      resetting all routers to this new aggregate bandwidth value.  This\
      should be what is necessary to prevent a ResvTear message from\
      being generated by R10 towards R6 and R5.\
\
   R5 will not know through this RESV message which individual flow was\
   preempted.  If in this example, R8 was given more bandwidth to keep,\
   it might have transmitted a bandwidth reduction ResvErr indication\
   towards the end-system of Flow D.  In that case, a voice signaling\
   protocol (such as SIP) could have attempted a renegotiation of that\
   individual flow to a reduced bandwidth (say, but changing the voice\
   codec from G.711 to G. 729).  This could have saved Flow D from\
   preemption.\
